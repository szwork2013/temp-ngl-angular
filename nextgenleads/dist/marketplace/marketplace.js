 *
 * # ngAnimate
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.
 *
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * To see animations in action, all that is required is to define the appropriate CSS classes
 * or to register a JavaScript animation via the myModule.animation() function. The directives that support animation automatically are:
 * `ngRepeat`, `ngInclude`, `ngIf`, `ngSwitch`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngView` and `ngClass`. Custom directives can take advantage of animation
 * by using the `$animate` service.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the supported animation events provided by pre-existing ng directives:
 *
 * | Directive                                                 | Supported Animations                               |
 * |---------------------------------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#usage_animations ngRepeat}         | enter, leave and move                              |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#usage_animations ngView}        | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#usage_animations ngInclude}       | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#usage_animations ngSwitch}         | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#usage_animations ngIf}                 | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#usage_animations ngClass}           | add and remove                                     |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#usage_animations ngShow & ngHide}    | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)           |
 * | {@link ng.directive:form#usage_animations form}                 | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations)                |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngModel#usage_animations ngModel}           | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations)                |
 *
 * You can find out more information about animations upon visiting each directive page.
 *
 * Below is an example of how to apply animations to a directive that supports animation hooks:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .slide.ng-enter, .slide.ng-leave {
 *   -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .slide.ng-enter { }        /&#42; starting animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave { }        /&#42; starting animations for leave &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for leave &#42;/
 * </style>
 *
 * <!--
 * the animate service will automatically add .ng-enter and .ng-leave to the element
 * to trigger the CSS transition/animations
 * -->
 * <ANY class="slide" ng-include="..."></ANY>
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that if an animation is running, any child elements cannot be animated until the parent element's
 * animation has completed.
 *
 * <h2>CSS-defined Animations</h2>
 * The animate service will automatically apply two CSS classes to the animated element and these two CSS classes
 * are designed to contain the start and end CSS styling. Both CSS transitions and keyframe animations are supported
 * and can be used to play along with this naming structure.
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS transitions** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * /&#42;
 *  The animate class is apart of the element and the ng-enter class
 *  is attached to the element once the enter animation event is triggered
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *  -webkit-transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *  transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; All other modern browsers and IE10+ &#42;/
 *
 *  /&#42; The animation preparation code &#42;/
 *  opacity: 0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42;
 *  Keep in mind that you want to combine both CSS
 *  classes together to avoid any CSS-specificity
 *  conflicts
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *  /&#42; The animation code itself &#42;/
 *  opacity: 1;
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS animations** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *   -webkit-animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *   animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; IE10+ and Future Browsers &#42;/
 * }
 * @-webkit-keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * @keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Both CSS3 animations and transitions can be used together and the animate service will figure out the correct duration and delay timing.
 *
 * Upon DOM mutation, the event class is added first (something like `ng-enter`), then the browser prepares itself to add
 * the active class (in this case `ng-enter-active`) which then triggers the animation. The animation module will automatically
 * detect the CSS code to determine when the animation ends. Once the animation is over then both CSS classes will be
 * removed from the DOM. If a browser does not support CSS transitions or CSS animations then the animation will start and end
 * immediately resulting in a DOM element that is at its final state. This final state is when the DOM element
 * has no CSS transition/animation classes applied to it.
 *
 * <h3>CSS Staggering Animations</h3>
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module, as of 1.2.0, supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition: 1s linear all;
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; in case the stagger doesn't work then these two values
 *    must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-duration: 0s;
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if more than 10ms has passed after the last animation has been fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * ```js
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * $timeout(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 * }, 100, false);
 * ```
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * <h2>JavaScript-defined Animations</h2>
 * In the event that you do not want to use CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations or if you wish to offer animations on browsers that do not
 * yet support CSS transitions/animations, then you can make use of JavaScript animations defined inside of your AngularJS module.
 *
 * ```js
 * //!annotate="YourApp" Your AngularJS Module|Replace this or ngModule with the module that you used to define your application.
 * var ngModule = angular.module('YourApp', ['ngAnimate']);
 * ngModule.animation('.my-crazy-animation', function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, done) {
 *       //run the animation here and call done when the animation is complete
 *       return function(cancelled) {
 *         //this (optional) function will be called when the animation
 *         //completes or when the animation is cancelled (the cancelled
 *         //flag will be set to true if cancelled).
 *       };
 *     },
 *     leave: function(element, done) { },
 *     move: function(element, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is added
 *     beforeAddClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is added
 *     addClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is removed
 *     beforeRemoveClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is removed
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, done) { }
 *   };
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * JavaScript-defined animations are created with a CSS-like class selector and a collection of events which are set to run
 * a javascript callback function. When an animation is triggered, $animate will look for a matching animation which fits
 * the element's CSS class attribute value and then run the matching animation event function (if found).
 * In other words, if the CSS classes present on the animated element match any of the JavaScript animations then the callback function will
 * be executed. It should be also noted that only simple, single class selectors are allowed (compound class selectors are not supported).
 *
 * Within a JavaScript animation, an object containing various event callback animation functions is expected to be returned.
 * As explained above, these callbacks are triggered based on the animation event. Therefore if an enter animation is run,
 * and the JavaScript animation is found, then the enter callback will handle that animation (in addition to the CSS keyframe animation
 * or transition code that is defined via a stylesheet).

       * @description
       * The `$animate` service provides animation detection support while performing DOM operations (enter, leave and move) as well as during addClass and removeClass operations.
       * When any of these operations are run, the $animate service
       * will examine any JavaScript-defined animations (which are defined by using the $animateProvider provider object)
       * as well as any CSS-defined animations against the CSS classes present on the element once the DOM operation is run.
       *
       * The `$animate` service is used behind the scenes with pre-existing directives and animation with these directives
       * will work out of the box without any extra configuration.
       *
       * Requires the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module to be installed.
       *
       * Please visit the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module overview page learn more about how to use animations in your application.

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $resource
 * @requires $http
 *
 * @description
 * A factory which creates a resource object that lets you interact with
 * [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) server-side data sources.
 *
 * The returned resource object has action methods which provide high-level behaviors without
 * the need to interact with the low level {@link ng.$http $http} service.
 *
 * Requires the {@link ngResource `ngResource`} module to be installed.
 *
 * @param {string} url A parametrized URL template with parameters prefixed by `:` as in
 *   `/user/:username`. If you are using a URL with a port number (e.g.
 *   `http://example.com:8080/api`), it will be respected.
 *
 *   If you are using a url with a suffix, just add the suffix, like this:
 *   `$resource('http://example.com/resource.json')` or `$resource('http://example.com/:id.json')`
 *   or even `$resource('http://example.com/resource/:resource_id.:format')`
 *   If the parameter before the suffix is empty, :resource_id in this case, then the `/.` will be
 *   collapsed down to a single `.`.  If you need this sequence to appear and not collapse then you
 *   can escape it with `/\.`.
 *
 * @param {Object=} paramDefaults Default values for `url` parameters. These can be overridden in
 *   `actions` methods. If any of the parameter value is a function, it will be executed every time
 *   when a param value needs to be obtained for a request (unless the param was overridden).
 *
 *   Each key value in the parameter object is first bound to url template if present and then any
 *   excess keys are appended to the url search query after the `?`.
 *
 *   Given a template `/path/:verb` and parameter `{verb:'greet', salutation:'Hello'}` results in
 *   URL `/path/greet?salutation=Hello`.
 *
 *   If the parameter value is prefixed with `@` then the value of that parameter will be taken
 *   from the corresponding key on the data object (useful for non-GET operations).
 *
 * @param {Object.<Object>=} actions Hash with declaration of custom action that should extend
 *   the default set of resource actions. The declaration should be created in the format of {@link
 *   ng.$http#usage_parameters $http.config}:
 *
 *       {action1: {method:?, params:?, isArray:?, headers:?, ...},
 *        action2: {method:?, params:?, isArray:?, headers:?, ...},
 *        ...}
 *
 *   Where:
 *
 *   - **`action`** – {string} – The name of action. This name becomes the name of the method on
 *     your resource object.
 *   - **`method`** – {string} – HTTP request method. Valid methods are: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`,
 *     `DELETE`, and `JSONP`.
 *   - **`params`** – {Object=} – Optional set of pre-bound parameters for this action. If any of
 *     the parameter value is a function, it will be executed every time when a param value needs to
 *     be obtained for a request (unless the param was overridden).
 *   - **`url`** – {string} – action specific `url` override. The url templating is supported just
 *     like for the resource-level urls.
 *   - **`isArray`** – {boolean=} – If true then the returned object for this action is an array,
 *     see `returns` section.
 *   - **`transformRequest`** –
 *     `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
 *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
 *     request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.
 *   - **`transformResponse`** –
 *     `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
 *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
 *     response body and headers and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.
 *   - **`cache`** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the
 *     GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with
 *     {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for
 *     caching.
 *   - **`timeout`** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise} that
 *     should abort the request when resolved.
 *   - **`withCredentials`** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the
 *     XHR object. See
 *     [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control#section_5)
 *     for more information.
 *   - **`responseType`** - `{string}` - see
 *     [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).
 *   - **`interceptor`** - `{Object=}` - The interceptor object has two optional methods -
 *     `response` and `responseError`. Both `response` and `responseError` interceptors get called
 *     with `http response` object. See {@link ng.$http $http interceptors}.
 *
 * @returns {Object} A resource "class" object with methods for the default set of resource actions
 *   optionally extended with custom `actions`. The default set contains these actions:
 *   ```js
 *   { 'get':    {method:'GET'},
 *     'save':   {method:'POST'},
 *     'query':  {method:'GET', isArray:true},
 *     'remove': {method:'DELETE'},
 *     'delete': {method:'DELETE'} };
 *   ```
 *
 *   Calling these methods invoke an {@link ng.$http} with the specified http method,
 *   destination and parameters. When the data is returned from the server then the object is an
 *   instance of the resource class. The actions `save`, `remove` and `delete` are available on it
 *   as  methods with the `$` prefix. This allows you to easily perform CRUD operations (create,
 *   read, update, delete) on server-side data like this:
 *   ```js
 *   var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
 *   var user = User.get({userId:123}, function() {
 *     user.abc = true;
 *     user.$save();
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 *   It is important to realize that invoking a $resource object method immediately returns an
 *   empty reference (object or array depending on `isArray`). Once the data is returned from the
 *   server the existing reference is populated with the actual data. This is a useful trick since
 *   usually the resource is assigned to a model which is then rendered by the view. Having an empty
 *   object results in no rendering, once the data arrives from the server then the object is
 *   populated with the data and the view automatically re-renders itself showing the new data. This
 *   means that in most cases one never has to write a callback function for the action methods.
 *
 *   The action methods on the class object or instance object can be invoked with the following
 *   parameters:
 *
 *   - HTTP GET "class" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], [success], [error])`
 *   - non-GET "class" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], postData, [success], [error])`
 *   - non-GET instance actions:  `instance.$action([parameters], [success], [error])`
 *
 *   Success callback is called with (value, responseHeaders) arguments. Error callback is called
 *   with (httpResponse) argument.
 *
 *   Class actions return empty instance (with additional properties below).
 *   Instance actions return promise of the action.
 *
 *   The Resource instances and collection have these additional properties:
 *
 *   - `$promise`: the {@link ng.$q promise} of the original server interaction that created this
 *     instance or collection.
 *
 *     On success, the promise is resolved with the same resource instance or collection object,
 *     updated with data from server. This makes it easy to use in
 *     {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider resolve section of $routeProvider.when()} to defer view
 *     rendering until the resource(s) are loaded.
 *
 *     On failure, the promise is resolved with the {@link ng.$http http response} object, without
 *     the `resource` property.
 *
 *     If an interceptor object was provided, the promise will instead be resolved with the value
 *     returned by the interceptor.
 *
 *   - `$resolved`: `true` after first server interaction is completed (either with success or
 *      rejection), `false` before that. Knowing if the Resource has been resolved is useful in
 *      data-binding.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * # Credit card resource
 *
 * ```js
     // Define CreditCard class
     var CreditCard = $resource('/user/:userId/card/:cardId',
      {userId:123, cardId:'@id'}, {
       charge: {method:'POST', params:{charge:true}}
      });

     // We can retrieve a collection from the server
     var cards = CreditCard.query(function() {
       // GET: /user/123/card
       // server returns: [ {id:456, number:'1234', name:'Smith'} ];

       var card = cards[0];
       // each item is an instance of CreditCard
       expect(card instanceof CreditCard).toEqual(true);
       card.name = "J. Smith";
       // non GET methods are mapped onto the instances
       card.$save();
       // POST: /user/123/card/456 {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}
       // server returns: {id:456, number:'1234', name: 'J. Smith'};

       // our custom method is mapped as well.
       card.$charge({amount:9.99});
       // POST: /user/123/card/456?amount=9.99&charge=true {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}
     });

     // we can create an instance as well
     var newCard = new CreditCard({number:'0123'});
     newCard.name = "Mike Smith";
     newCard.$save();
     // POST: /user/123/card {number:'0123', name:'Mike Smith'}
     // server returns: {id:789, number:'0123', name: 'Mike Smith'};
     expect(newCard.id).toEqual(789);
 * ```
 *
 * The object returned from this function execution is a resource "class" which has "static" method
 * for each action in the definition.
 *
 * Calling these methods invoke `$http` on the `url` template with the given `method`, `params` and
 * `headers`.
 * When the data is returned from the server then the object is an instance of the resource type and
 * all of the non-GET methods are available with `$` prefix. This allows you to easily support CRUD
 * operations (create, read, update, delete) on server-side data.

   ```js
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     User.get({userId:123}, function(user) {
       user.abc = true;
       user.$save();
     });
   ```
 *
 * It's worth noting that the success callback for `get`, `query` and other methods gets passed
 * in the response that came from the server as well as $http header getter function, so one
 * could rewrite the above example and get access to http headers as:
 *
   ```js
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     User.get({userId:123}, function(u, getResponseHeaders){
       u.abc = true;
       u.$save(function(u, putResponseHeaders) {
         //u => saved user object
         //putResponseHeaders => $http header getter
       });
     });
   ```
 *
 * You can also access the raw `$http` promise via the `$promise` property on the object returned
 *
   ```
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     User.get({userId:123})
         .$promise.then(function(user) {
           $scope.user = user;
         });
   ```

 * # Creating a custom 'PUT' request
 * In this example we create a custom method on our resource to make a PUT request
 * ```js
 *		var app = angular.module('app', ['ngResource', 'ngRoute']);
 *
 *		// Some APIs expect a PUT request in the format URL/object/ID
 *		// Here we are creating an 'update' method
 *		app.factory('Notes', ['$resource', function($resource) {
 *    return $resource('/notes/:id', null,
 *        {
 *            'update': { method:'PUT' }
 *        });
 *		}]);
 *
 *		// In our controller we get the ID from the URL using ngRoute and $routeParams
 *		// We pass in $routeParams and our Notes factory along with $scope
 *		app.controller('NotesCtrl', ['$scope', '$routeParams', 'Notes',
                                      function($scope, $routeParams, Notes) {
 *    // First get a note object from the factory
 *    var note = Notes.get({ id:$routeParams.id });
 *    $id = note.id;
 *
 *    // Now call update passing in the ID first then the object you are updating
 *    Notes.update({ id:$id }, note);
 *
 *    // This will PUT /notes/ID with the note object in the request payload
 *		}]);
 * ```

/**
 * @ngdoc service

 *
 * @description
 *   The input is sanitized by parsing the html into tokens. All safe tokens (from a whitelist) are
 *   then serialized back to properly escaped html string. This means that no unsafe input can make
 *   it into the returned string, however, since our parser is more strict than a typical browser
 *   parser, it's possible that some obscure input, which would be recognized as valid HTML by a
 *   browser, won't make it through the sanitizer.
 *   The whitelist is configured using the functions `aHrefSanitizationWhitelist` and
 *   `imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist` of {@link ng.$compileProvider `$compileProvider`}.
 *
 * @param {string} html Html input.
 * @returns {string} Sanitized html.

  // TAP EVENTS AND GHOST CLICKS
  //
  // Why tap events?
  // Mobile browsers detect a tap, then wait a moment (usually ~300ms) to see if you're
  // double-tapping, and then fire a click event.
  //
  // This delay sucks and makes mobile apps feel unresponsive.
  // So we detect touchstart, touchmove, touchcancel and touchend ourselves and determine when
  // the user has tapped on something.
  //
  // What happens when the browser then generates a click event?
  // The browser, of course, also detects the tap and fires a click after a delay. This results in
  // tapping/clicking twice. We do "clickbusting" to prevent it.
  //
  // How does it work?
  // We attach global touchstart and click handlers, that run during the capture (early) phase.
  // So the sequence for a tap is:
  // - global touchstart: Sets an "allowable region" at the point touched.
  // - element's touchstart: Starts a touch
  // (- touchmove or touchcancel ends the touch, no click follows)
  // - element's touchend: Determines if the tap is valid (didn't move too far away, didn't hold
  //   too long) and fires the user's tap handler. The touchend also calls preventGhostClick().
  // - preventGhostClick() removes the allowable region the global touchstart created.
  // - The browser generates a click event.
  // - The global click handler catches the click, and checks whether it was in an allowable region.
  //     - If preventGhostClick was called, the region will have been removed, the click is busted.
  //     - If the region is still there, the click proceeds normally. Therefore clicks on links and
  //       other elements without ngTap on them work normally.

   * @ngdoc function
   * @name ui.router.util.$resolve#resolve
   * @methodOf ui.router.util.$resolve
   *
   * @description
   * Resolves a set of invocables. An invocable is a function to be invoked via 
   * `$injector.invoke()`, and can have an arbitrary number of dependencies. 
   * An invocable can either return a value directly,
   * or a `$q` promise. If a promise is returned it will be resolved and the 
   * resulting value will be used instead. Dependencies of invocables are resolved 
   * (in this order of precedence)
   *
   * - from the specified `locals`
   * - from another invocable that is part of this `$resolve` call
   * - from an invocable that is inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve` 
   *   (or recursively
   * - from any ancestor `$resolve` of that parent).
   *
   * The return value of `$resolve` is a promise for an object that contains 
   * (in this order of precedence)
   *
   * - any `locals` (if specified)
   * - the resolved return values of all injectables
   * - any values inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve` (if specified)
   *
   * The promise will resolve after the `parent` promise (if any) and all promises 
   * returned by injectables have been resolved. If any invocable 
   * (or `$injector.invoke`) throws an exception, or if a promise returned by an 
   * invocable is rejected, the `$resolve` promise is immediately rejected with the 
   * same error. A rejection of a `parent` promise (if specified) will likewise be 
   * propagated immediately. Once the `$resolve` promise has been rejected, no 
   * further invocables will be called.
   * 
   * Cyclic dependencies between invocables are not permitted and will caues `$resolve`
   * to throw an error. As a special case, an injectable can depend on a parameter 
   * with the same name as the injectable, which will be fulfilled from the `parent` 
   * injectable of the same name. This allows inherited values to be decorated. 
   * Note that in this case any other injectable in the same `$resolve` with the same
   * dependency would see the decorated value, not the inherited value.
   *
   * Note that missing dependencies -- unlike cyclic dependencies -- will cause an 
   * (asynchronous) rejection of the `$resolve` promise rather than a (synchronous) 
   * exception.
   *
   * Invocables are invoked eagerly as soon as all dependencies are available. 
   * This is true even for dependencies inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve`.
   *
   * As a special case, an invocable can be a string, in which case it is taken to 
   * be a service name to be passed to `$injector.get()`. This is supported primarily 
   * for backwards-compatibility with the `resolve` property of `$routeProvider` 
   * routes.
   *
   * @param {object} invocables functions to invoke or 
   * `$injector` services to fetch.
   * @param {object} locals  values to make available to the injectables
   * @param {object} parent  a promise returned by another call to `$resolve`.
   * @param {object} self  the `this` for the invoked methods
   * @return {object} Promise for an object that contains the resolved return value
   * of all invocables, as well as any inherited and local values.

/**
 * @ngdoc object
 * @name ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher
 *
 * @description
 * Matches URLs against patterns and extracts named parameters from the path or the search
 * part of the URL. A URL pattern consists of a path pattern, optionally followed by '?' and a list
 * of search parameters. Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters
 * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into
 * the matched parameters returned by {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec}.
 * 
 * Path parameter placeholders can be specified using simple colon/catch-all syntax or curly brace
 * syntax, which optionally allows a regular expression for the parameter to be specified:
 *
 * * `':'` name - colon placeholder
 * * `'*'` name - catch-all placeholder
 * * `'{' name '}'` - curly placeholder
 * * `'{' name ':' regexp '}'` - curly placeholder with regexp. Should the regexp itself contain
 *   curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.
 *
 * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and
 * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters). For colon 
 * placeholders or curly placeholders without an explicit regexp, a path parameter matches any
 * number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all placeholders the path parameter matches
 * any number of characters.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for
 *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.
 * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or
 *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.
 * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.
 * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.
 * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id
 *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.
 * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the
 *   path into the parameter 'path'.
 * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.
 *
 * @param {string} pattern  the pattern to compile into a matcher.
 *
 * @property {string} prefix  A static prefix of this pattern. The matcher guarantees that any
 *   URL matching this matcher (i.e. any string for which {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec()} returns
 *   non-null) will start with this prefix.
 *
 * @property {string} source  The pattern that was passed into the contructor
 *
 * @property {string} sourcePath  The path portion of the source property
 *
 * @property {string} sourceSearch  The search portion of the source property
 *
 * @property {string} regex  The constructed regex that will be used to match against the url when 
 *   it is time to determine which url will match.
 *
 * @returns {Object}  New UrlMatcher object

  /**
   * @ngdoc function
   * @name ui.router.state.$stateProvider#decorator
   * @methodOf ui.router.state.$stateProvider
   *
   * @description
   * Allows you to extend (carefully) or override (at your own peril) the 
   * `stateBuilder` object used internally by `$stateProvider`. This can be used 
   * to add custom functionality to ui-router, for example inferring templateUrl 
   * based on the state name.
   *
   * When passing only a name, it returns the current (original or decorated) builder
   * function that matches `name`.
   *
   * The builder functions that can be decorated are listed below. Though not all
   * necessarily have a good use case for decoration, that is up to you to decide.
   *
   * In addition, users can attach custom decorators, which will generate new 
   * properties within the state's internal definition. There is currently no clear 
   * use-case for this beyond accessing internal states (i.e. $state.$current), 
   * however, expect this to become increasingly relevant as we introduce additional 
   * meta-programming features.
   *
   * **Warning**: Decorators should not be interdependent because the order of 
   * execution of the builder functions in non-deterministic. Builder functions 
   * should only be dependent on the state definition object and super function.
   *
   *
   * Existing builder functions and current return values:
   *
   * - **parent** `{object}` - returns the parent state object.
   * - **data** `{object}` - returns state data, including any inherited data that is not
   *   overridden by own values (if any).
   * - **url** `{object}` - returns a {link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher} or null.
   * - **navigable** `{object}` - returns closest ancestor state that has a URL (aka is 
   *   navigable).
   * - **params** `{object}` - returns an array of state params that are ensured to 
   *   be a super-set of parent's params.
   * - **views** `{object}` - returns a views object where each key is an absolute view 
   *   name (i.e. "viewName@stateName") and each value is the config object 
   *   (template, controller) for the view. Even when you don't use the views object 
   *   explicitly on a state config, one is still created for you internally.
   *   So by decorating this builder function you have access to decorating template 
   *   and controller properties.
   * - **ownParams** `{object}` - returns an array of params that belong to the state, 
   *   not including any params defined by ancestor states.
   * - **path** `{string}` - returns the full path from the root down to this state. 
   *   Needed for state activation.
   * - **includes** `{object}` - returns an object that includes every state that 
   *   would pass a '$state.includes()' test.
   *

   *     result[name] = config;
   *   });
   *   return result;
   * });
   *

   * @methodOf ui.router.state.$stateProvider
   *
   * @description
   * Registers a state configuration under a given state name. The stateConfig object
   * has the following acceptable properties.
   *
   * <a id='template'></a>
   *
   * - **`template`** - {string|function=} - html template as a string or a function that returns
   *   an html template as a string which should be used by the uiView directives. This property 
   *   takes precedence over templateUrl.
   *   
   *   If `template` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *   - {array.&lt;object&gt;} - state parameters extracted from the current $location.path() by
   *     applying the current state
   *
   * <a id='templateUrl'></a>
   *
   * - **`templateUrl`** - {string|function=} - path or function that returns a path to an html 
   *   template that should be used by uiView.
   *   
   *   If `templateUrl` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *   - {array.&lt;object&gt;} - state parameters extracted from the current $location.path() by 
   *     applying the current state
   *
   * <a id='templateProvider'></a>
   *
   * - **`templateProvider`** - {function=} - Provider function that returns HTML content
   *   string.
   *
   * <a id='controller'></a>
   *
   * - **`controller`** - {string|function=} -  Controller fn that should be associated with newly 
   *   related scope or the name of a registered controller if passed as a string.
   *
   * <a id='controllerProvider'></a>
   *
   * - **`controllerProvider`** - {function=} - Injectable provider function that returns
   *   the actual controller or string.
   *
   * <a id='controllerAs'></a>
   * 
   * - **`controllerAs`** – {string=} – A controller alias name. If present the controller will be 
   *   published to scope under the controllerAs name.
   *
   * <a id='resolve'></a>
   *
   * - **`resolve`** - {object.&lt;string, function&gt;=} - An optional map of dependencies which 
   *   should be injected into the controller. If any of these dependencies are promises, 
   *   the router will wait for them all to be resolved or one to be rejected before the 
   *   controller is instantiated. If all the promises are resolved successfully, the values 
   *   of the resolved promises are injected and $stateChangeSuccess event is fired. If any 
   *   of the promises are rejected the $stateChangeError event is fired. The map object is:
   *   
   *   - key - {string}: name of dependency to be injected into controller
   *   - factory - {string|function}: If string then it is alias for service. Otherwise if function, 
   *     it is injected and return value it treated as dependency. If result is a promise, it is 
   *     resolved before its value is injected into controller.
   *
   * <a id='url'></a>
   *
   * - **`url`** - {string=} - A url with optional parameters. When a state is navigated or
   *   transitioned to, the `$stateParams` service will be populated with any 
   *   parameters that were passed.
   *
   * <a id='params'></a>
   *
   * - **`params`** - {object=} - An array of parameter names or regular expressions. Only 
   *   use this within a state if you are not using url. Otherwise you can specify your
   *   parameters within the url. When a state is navigated or transitioned to, the 
   *   $stateParams service will be populated with any parameters that were passed.
   *
   * <a id='views'></a>
   *
   * - **`views`** - {object=} - Use the views property to set up multiple views or to target views
   *   manually/explicitly.
   *
   * <a id='abstract'></a>
   *
   * - **`abstract`** - {boolean=} - An abstract state will never be directly activated, 
   *   but can provide inherited properties to its common children states.
   *
   * <a id='onEnter'></a>
   *
   * - **`onEnter`** - {object=} - Callback function for when a state is entered. Good way
   *   to trigger an action or dispatch an event, such as opening a dialog.
   *
   * <a id='onExit'></a>
   *
   * - **`onExit`** - {object=} - Callback function for when a state is exited. Good way to
   *   trigger an action or dispatch an event, such as opening a dialog.
   *
   * <a id='reloadOnSearch'></a>
   *
   * - **`reloadOnSearch = true`** - {boolean=} - If `false`, will not retrigger the same state 
   *   just because a search/query parameter has changed (via $location.search() or $location.hash()). 
   *   Useful for when you'd like to modify $location.search() without triggering a reload.
   *
   * <a id='data'></a>
   *
   * - **`data`** - {object=} - Arbitrary data object, useful for custom configuration.
   *
   * @example
   * <pre>
   * // Some state name examples
   *
   * // stateName can be a single top-level name (must be unique).
   * $stateProvider.state("home", {});
   *
   * // Or it can be a nested state name. This state is a child of the 
   * // above "home" state.
   * $stateProvider.state("home.newest", {});
   *
   * // Nest states as deeply as needed.
   * $stateProvider.state("home.newest.abc.xyz.inception", {});
   *
   * // state() returns $stateProvider, so you can chain state declarations.
   * $stateProvider
   *   .state("home", {})
   *   .state("about", {})
   *   .state("contacts", {});
   * </pre>
   *
   * @param {string} name A unique state name, e.g. "home", "about", "contacts".

     * @methodOf ui.router.state.$state
     *
     * @description
     * Convenience method for transitioning to a new state. `$state.go` calls 
     * `$state.transitionTo` internally but automatically sets options to 
     * `{ location: true, inherit: true, relative: $state.$current, notify: true }`. 
     * This allows you to easily use an absolute or relative to path and specify 
     * only the parameters you'd like to update (while letting unspecified parameters 
     * inherit from the currently active ancestor states).
     *
     * @example
     * <pre>
     * var app = angular.module('app', ['ui.router']);
     *
     * app.controller('ctrl', function ($scope, $state) {
     *   $scope.changeState = function () {

     * @param {string} to Absolute state name or relative state path. Some examples:
     *
     * - `$state.go('contact.detail')` - will go to the `contact.detail` state
     * - `$state.go('^')` - will go to a parent state
     * - `$state.go('^.sibling')` - will go to a sibling state
     * - `$state.go('.child.grandchild')` - will go to grandchild state
     *
     * @param {object=} params A map of the parameters that will be sent to the state, 
     * will populate $stateParams. Any parameters that are not specified will be inherited from currently 
     * defined parameters. This allows, for example, going to a sibling state that shares parameters
     * specified in a parent state. Parameter inheritance only works between common ancestor states, I.e.
     * transitioning to a sibling will get you the parameters for all parents, transitioning to a child
     * will get you all current parameters, etc.
     * @param {object=} options Options object. The options are:
     *
     * - **`location`** - {boolean=true|string=} - If `true` will update the url in the location bar, if `false`
     *    will not. If string, must be `"replace"`, which will update url and also replace last history record.
     * - **`inherit`** - {boolean=true}, If `true` will inherit url parameters from current url.
     * - **`relative`** - {object=$state.$current}, When transitioning with relative path (e.g '^'), 
     *    defines which state to be relative from.
     * - **`notify`** - {boolean=true}, If `true` will broadcast $stateChangeStart and $stateChangeSuccess events.
     * - **`reload`** (v0.2.5) - {boolean=false}, If `true` will force transition even if the state or params 
     *    have not changed, aka a reload of the same state. It differs from reloadOnSearch because you'd
     *    use this when you want to force a reload when *everything* is the same, including search params.
     *
     * @returns {promise} A promise representing the state of the new transition.
     *
     * Possible success values:
     *
     * - $state.current
     *
     * <br/>Possible rejection values:
     *
     * - 'transition superseded' - when a newer transition has been started after this one
     * - 'transition prevented' - when `event.preventDefault()` has been called in a `$stateChangeStart` listener
     * - 'transition aborted' - when `event.preventDefault()` has been called in a `$stateNotFound` listener or
     *   when a `$stateNotFound` `event.retry` promise errors.
     * - 'transition failed' - when a state has been unsuccessfully found after 2 tries.
     * - *resolve error* - when an error has occurred with a `resolve`

 *

 *
 * @description
 * The ui-view directive tells $state where to place your templates.
 *
 * @param {string=} ui-view A view name. The name should be unique amongst the other views in the
 * same state. You can have views of the same name that live in different states.
 *
 * @param {string=} autoscroll It allows you to set the scroll behavior of the browser window
 * when a view is populated. By default, $anchorScroll is overridden by ui-router's custom scroll
 * service, {@link ui.router.state.$uiViewScroll}. This custom service let's you
 * scroll ui-view elements into view when they are populated during a state activation.
 *
 * *Note: To revert back to old [`$anchorScroll`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$anchorScroll)
 * functionality, call `$uiViewScrollProvider.useAnchorScroll()`.*
 *
 * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.
 * 
 * @example
 * A view can be unnamed or named. 
 * <pre>
 * <!-- Unnamed -->
 * <div ui-view></div> 
 * 
 * <!-- Named -->
 * <div ui-view="viewName"></div>
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a 
 * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view></div> 
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 * })
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the {@link ui.router.state.$stateProvider#views `views`}
 * config property, by name, in this case an empty name:
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 * 
 * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view 
 * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one, 
 * but you could if you wanted, like so:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view="main"></div>
 * </pre> 
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "main": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view></div>
 * <div ui-view="chart"></div> 
 * <div ui-view="data"></div> 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     },
 *     "chart": {
 *       template: "<chart_thing/>"
 *     },
 *     "data": {
 *       template: "<data_thing/>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 *
 * Examples for `autoscroll`:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,
 *      then scroll ui-view into view -->
 * <ui-view autoscroll/>
 *
 * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,
 *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->
 * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>
 * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>
 * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>
 * </pre>

 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ui.router.state.directive:ui-sref
 *
 * @requires ui.router.state.$state
 * @requires $timeout
 *
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * A directive that binds a link (`<a>` tag) to a state. If the state has an associated 
 * URL, the directive will automatically generate & update the `href` attribute via 
 * the {@link ui.router.state.$state#methods_href $state.href()} method. Clicking 
 * the link will trigger a state transition with optional parameters. 
 *
 * Also middle-clicking, right-clicking, and ctrl-clicking on the link will be 
 * handled natively by the browser.
 *
 * You can also use relative state paths within ui-sref, just like the relative 
 * paths passed to `$state.go()`. You just need to be aware that the path is relative
 * to the state that the link lives in, in other words the state that loaded the 
 * template containing the link.
 *
 * You can specify options to pass to {@link ui.router.state.$state#go $state.go()}
 * using the `ui-sref-opts` attribute. Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`,
 * and `reload`.
 *
 * @example
 * Here's an example of how you'd use ui-sref and how it would compile. If you have the 
 * following template:
 * <pre>
 * <a ui-sref="home">Home</a> | <a ui-sref="about">About</a>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">{{ contact.name }}</a>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Then the compiled html would be (assuming Html5Mode is off):
 * <pre>
 * <a href="#/home" ui-sref="home">Home</a> | <a href="#/about" ui-sref="about">About</a>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/1" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Joe</a>
 *     </li>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/2" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Alice</a>
 *     </li>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/3" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Bob</a>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <a ui-sref="home" ui-sref-opts="{reload: true}">Home</a>
 * </pre>

 * @param {Object} ui-sref-opts options to pass to {@link ui.router.state.$state#go $state.go()}

 * @requires $interpolate
 *
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * A directive working alongside ui-sref to add classes to an element when the 
 * related ui-sref directive's state is active, and removing them when it is inactive.
 * The primary use-case is to simplify the special appearance of navigation menus 
 * relying on `ui-sref`, by having the "active" state's menu button appear different,
 * distinguishing it from the inactive menu items.
 *
 * @example
 * Given the following template:
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active="active" class="item">
 *     <a href ui-sref="app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})">@bilbobaggins</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * When the app state is "app.user", and contains the state parameter "user" with value "bilbobaggins", 
 * the resulting HTML will appear as (note the 'active' class):
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active="active" class="item active">
 *     <a ui-sref="app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})" href="/users/bilbobaggins">@bilbobaggins</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The class name is interpolated **once** during the directives link time (any further changes to the 
 * interpolated value are ignored). 
 * 
 * Multiple classes may be specified in a space-separated format:
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active='class1 class2 class3'>
 *     <a ui-sref="app.user">link</a>
 *   </li>

 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngApp
 * @module ng
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {angular.Module} ngApp an optional application
 *   {@link angular.module module} name to load.
 *
 * @description
 *
 * Use this directive to **auto-bootstrap** an AngularJS application. The `ngApp` directive
 * designates the **root element** of the application and is typically placed near the root element
 * of the page - e.g. on the `<body>` or `<html>` tags.
 *
 * Only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped per HTML document. The first `ngApp`
 * found in the document will be used to define the root element to auto-bootstrap as an
 * application. To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using
 * {@link angular.bootstrap} instead. AngularJS applications cannot be nested within each other.
 *
 * You can specify an **AngularJS module** to be used as the root module for the application.  This
 * module will be loaded into the {@link auto.$injector} when the application is bootstrapped and
 * should contain the application code needed or have dependencies on other modules that will
 * contain the code. See {@link angular.module} for more information.
 *
 * In the example below if the `ngApp` directive were not placed on the `html` element then the
 * document would not be compiled, the `AppController` would not be instantiated and the `{{ a+b }}`
 * would not be resolved to `3`.
 *
 * `ngApp` is the easiest, and most common, way to bootstrap an application.
 *
 <example module="ngAppDemo">
   <file name="index.html">
   <div ng-controller="ngAppDemoController">
     I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}
   </div>
   </file>
   <file name="script.js">
   angular.module('ngAppDemo', []).controller('ngAppDemoController', function($scope) {
     $scope.a = 1;
     $scope.b = 2;

/**
 * @ngdoc function
 * @name angular.element
 * @module ng
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Wraps a raw DOM element or HTML string as a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) element.
 *
 * If jQuery is available, `angular.element` is an alias for the
 * [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/) function. If jQuery is not available, `angular.element`
 * delegates to Angular's built-in subset of jQuery, called "jQuery lite" or "jqLite."
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">jqLite is a tiny, API-compatible subset of jQuery that allows
 * Angular to manipulate the DOM in a cross-browser compatible way. **jqLite** implements only the most
 * commonly needed functionality with the goal of having a very small footprint.</div>
 *
 * To use jQuery, simply load it before `DOMContentLoaded` event fired.
 *
 * <div class="alert">**Note:** all element references in Angular are always wrapped with jQuery or
 * jqLite; they are never raw DOM references.</div>
 *
 * ## Angular's jqLite
 * jqLite provides only the following jQuery methods:
 *
 * - [`addClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/addClass/)
 * - [`after()`](http://api.jquery.com/after/)
 * - [`append()`](http://api.jquery.com/append/)
 * - [`attr()`](http://api.jquery.com/attr/)
 * - [`bind()`](http://api.jquery.com/bind/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData
 * - [`children()`](http://api.jquery.com/children/) - Does not support selectors
 * - [`clone()`](http://api.jquery.com/clone/)
 * - [`contents()`](http://api.jquery.com/contents/)
 * - [`css()`](http://api.jquery.com/css/)
 * - [`data()`](http://api.jquery.com/data/)
 * - [`empty()`](http://api.jquery.com/empty/)
 * - [`eq()`](http://api.jquery.com/eq/)
 * - [`find()`](http://api.jquery.com/find/) - Limited to lookups by tag name
 * - [`hasClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/)
 * - [`html()`](http://api.jquery.com/html/)
 * - [`next()`](http://api.jquery.com/next/) - Does not support selectors

 * - [`text()`](http://api.jquery.com/text/)
 * - [`toggleClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/)
 * - [`triggerHandler()`](http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/) - Passes a dummy event object to handlers.
 * - [`unbind()`](http://api.jquery.com/unbind/) - Does not support namespaces
 * - [`val()`](http://api.jquery.com/val/)
 * - [`wrap()`](http://api.jquery.com/wrap/)
 *
 * ## jQuery/jqLite Extras
 * Angular also provides the following additional methods and events to both jQuery and jqLite:
 *
 * ### Events
 * - `$destroy` - AngularJS intercepts all jqLite/jQuery's DOM destruction apis and fires this event
 *    on all DOM nodes being removed.  This can be used to clean up any 3rd party bindings to the DOM
 *    element before it is removed.
 *
 * ### Methods
 * - `controller(name)` - retrieves the controller of the current element or its parent. By default
 *   retrieves controller associated with the `ngController` directive. If `name` is provided as
 *   camelCase directive name, then the controller for this directive will be retrieved (e.g.
 *   `'ngModel'`).
 * - `injector()` - retrieves the injector of the current element or its parent.

 *   current element. This getter should be used only on elements that contain a directive which starts a new isolate

 *
 * In the following example a new block of HTML containing a `ng-controller`

 * it into the current AngularJS scope.
 *
 * ```js
 * var $div = $('<div ng-controller="MyCtrl">{{content.label}}</div>');

 * # Injection Function Annotation
 *
 * JavaScript does not have annotations, and annotations are needed for dependency injection. The
 * following are all valid ways of annotating function with injection arguments and are equivalent.
 *
 * ```js
 *   // inferred (only works if code not minified/obfuscated)
 *   $injector.invoke(function(serviceA){});
 *
 *   // annotated
 *   function explicit(serviceA) {};
 *   explicit.$inject = ['serviceA'];
 *   $injector.invoke(explicit);
 *
 *   // inline
 *   $injector.invoke(['serviceA', function(serviceA){}]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Inference
 *
 * In JavaScript calling `toString()` on a function returns the function definition. The definition
 * can then be parsed and the function arguments can be extracted. *NOTE:* This does not work with
 * minification, and obfuscation tools since these tools change the argument names.
 *
 * ## `$inject` Annotation
 * By adding an `$inject` property onto a function the injection parameters can be specified.
 *
 * ## Inline
 * As an array of injection names, where the last item in the array is the function to call.

/**

 * @name $injector#annotate
 *
 * @description
 * Returns an array of service names which the function is requesting for injection. This API is
 * used by the injector to determine which services need to be injected into the function when the
 * function is invoked. There are three ways in which the function can be annotated with the needed
 * dependencies.
 *
 * # Argument names
 *
 * The simplest form is to extract the dependencies from the arguments of the function. This is done
 * by converting the function into a string using `toString()` method and extracting the argument
 * names.
 * ```js
 *   // Given
 *   function MyController($scope, $route) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *
 *   // Then
 *   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);
 * ```
 *
 * This method does not work with code minification / obfuscation. For this reason the following
 * annotation strategies are supported.
 *
 * # The `$inject` property
 *
 * If a function has an `$inject` property and its value is an array of strings, then the strings
 * represent names of services to be injected into the function.
 * ```js
 *   // Given
 *   var MyController = function(obfuscatedScope, obfuscatedRoute) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *   // Define function dependencies
 *   MyController['$inject'] = ['$scope', '$route'];
 *
 *   // Then
 *   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);
 * ```
 *
 * # The array notation
 *
 * It is often desirable to inline Injected functions and that's when setting the `$inject` property
 * is very inconvenient. In these situations using the array notation to specify the dependencies in
 * a way that survives minification is a better choice:
 *
 * ```js
 *   // We wish to write this (not minification / obfuscation safe)
 *   injector.invoke(function($compile, $rootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   });
 *
 *   // We are forced to write break inlining
 *   var tmpFn = function(obfuscatedCompile, obfuscatedRootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   };
 *   tmpFn.$inject = ['$compile', '$rootScope'];
 *   injector.invoke(tmpFn);
 *
 *   // To better support inline function the inline annotation is supported
 *   injector.invoke(['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfCompile, obfRootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   }]);
 *
 *   // Therefore
 *   expect(injector.annotate(
 *      ['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfus_$compile, obfus_$rootScope) {}])
 *    ).toEqual(['$compile', '$rootScope']);
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Function|Array.<string|Function>} fn Function for which dependent service names need to
 * be retrieved as described above.
 *
 * @returns {Array.<string>} The names of the services which the function requires.

/**
 * @ngdoc object

 *
 * @description
 *
 * The {@link auto.$provide $provide} service has a number of methods for registering components
 * with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}. Many of these functions are also exposed on
 * {@link angular.Module}.
 *
 * An Angular **service** is a singleton object created by a **service factory**.  These **service
 * factories** are functions which, in turn, are created by a **service provider**.
 * The **service providers** are constructor functions. When instantiated they must contain a
 * property called `$get`, which holds the **service factory** function.
 *
 * When you request a service, the {@link auto.$injector $injector} is responsible for finding the
 * correct **service provider**, instantiating it and then calling its `$get` **service factory**
 * function to get the instance of the **service**.
 *
 * Often services have no configuration options and there is no need to add methods to the service
 * provider.  The provider will be no more than a constructor function with a `$get` property. For
 * these cases the {@link auto.$provide $provide} service has additional helper methods to register
 * services without specifying a provider.
 *
 * * {@link auto.$provide#provider provider(provider)} - registers a **service provider** with the
 *     {@link auto.$injector $injector}
 * * {@link auto.$provide#constant constant(obj)} - registers a value/object that can be accessed by
 *     providers and services.
 * * {@link auto.$provide#value value(obj)} - registers a value/object that can only be accessed by
 *     services, not providers.
 * * {@link auto.$provide#factory factory(fn)} - registers a service **factory function**, `fn`,
 *     that will be wrapped in a **service provider** object, whose `$get` property will contain the
 *     given factory function.
 * * {@link auto.$provide#service service(class)} - registers a **constructor function**, `class`
 *     that will be wrapped in a **service provider** object, whose `$get` property will instantiate
 *      a new object using the given constructor function.
 *
 * See the individual methods for more information and examples.

/**
 * @ngdoc method
 * @name $provide#provider
 * @description
 *
 * Register a **provider function** with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}. Provider functions
 * are constructor functions, whose instances are responsible for "providing" a factory for a
 * service.
 *
 * Service provider names start with the name of the service they provide followed by `Provider`.
 * For example, the {@link ng.$log $log} service has a provider called
 * {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider}.
 *
 * Service provider objects can have additional methods which allow configuration of the provider
 * and its service. Importantly, you can configure what kind of service is created by the `$get`
 * method, or how that service will act. For example, the {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider} has a
 * method {@link ng.$logProvider#debugEnabled debugEnabled}
 * which lets you specify whether the {@link ng.$log $log} service will log debug messages to the
 * console or not.
 *
 * @param {string} name The name of the instance. NOTE: the provider will be available under `name +
                        'Provider'` key.
 * @param {(Object|function())} provider If the provider is:
 *
 *   - `Object`: then it should have a `$get` method. The `$get` method will be invoked using
 *     {@link auto.$injector#invoke $injector.invoke()} when an instance needs to be created.
 *   - `Constructor`: a new instance of the provider will be created using
 *     {@link auto.$injector#instantiate $injector.instantiate()}, then treated as `object`.
 *
 * @returns {Object} registered provider instance

 * @example
 *
 * The following example shows how to create a simple event tracking service and register it using
 * {@link auto.$provide#provider $provide.provider()}.
 *
 * ```js
 *  // Define the eventTracker provider
 *  function EventTrackerProvider() {
 *    var trackingUrl = '/track';
 *
 *    // A provider method for configuring where the tracked events should been saved
 *    this.setTrackingUrl = function(url) {

 * The compilation is a process of walking the DOM tree and matching DOM elements to

 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** This document is an in-depth reference of all directive options.
 * For a gentle introduction to directives with examples of common use cases,
 * see the {@link guide/directive directive guide}.
 * </div>
 *
 * ## Comprehensive Directive API
 *
 * There are many different options for a directive.
 *
 * The difference resides in the return value of the factory function.
 * You can either return a "Directive Definition Object" (see below) that defines the directive properties,
 * or just the `postLink` function (all other properties will have the default values).
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">
 * **Best Practice:** It's recommended to use the "directive definition object" form.
 * </div>
 *
 * Here's an example directive declared with a Directive Definition Object:
 *
 * ```js
 *   var myModule = angular.module(...);
 *
 *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {
 *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {
 *       priority: 0,
 *       template: '<div></div>', // or // function(tElement, tAttrs) { ... },
 *       // or
 *       // templateUrl: 'directive.html', // or // function(tElement, tAttrs) { ... },
 *       transclude: false,
 *       restrict: 'A',
 *       scope: false,
 *       controller: function($scope, $element, $attrs, $transclude, otherInjectables) { ... },
 *       controllerAs: 'stringAlias',
 *       require: 'siblingDirectiveName', // or // ['^parentDirectiveName', '?optionalDirectiveName', '?^optionalParent'],
 *       compile: function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) {
 *         return {
 *           pre: function preLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... },
 *           post: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... }
 *         }
 *         // or
 *         // return function postLink( ... ) { ... }
 *       },
 *       // or
 *       // link: {
 *       //  pre: function preLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... },
 *       //  post: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... }
 *       // }
 *       // or
 *       // link: function postLink( ... ) { ... }
 *     };
 *     return directiveDefinitionObject;
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** Any unspecified options will use the default value. You can see the default values below.
 * </div>
 *
 * Therefore the above can be simplified as:
 *
 * ```js
 *   var myModule = angular.module(...);
 *
 *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {
 *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {
 *       link: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }
 *     };
 *     return directiveDefinitionObject;
 *     // or
 *     // return function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Directive Definition Object
 *
 * The directive definition object provides instructions to the {@link ng.$compile
 * compiler}. The attributes are:
 *
 * #### `priority`
 * When there are multiple directives defined on a single DOM element, sometimes it
 * is necessary to specify the order in which the directives are applied. The `priority` is used
 * to sort the directives before their `compile` functions get called. Priority is defined as a
 * number. Directives with greater numerical `priority` are compiled first. Pre-link functions
 * are also run in priority order, but post-link functions are run in reverse order. The order
 * of directives with the same priority is undefined. The default priority is `0`.
 *
 * #### `terminal`
 * If set to true then the current `priority` will be the last set of directives
 * which will execute (any directives at the current priority will still execute
 * as the order of execution on same `priority` is undefined).
 *
 * #### `scope`
 * **If set to `true`,** then a new scope will be created for this directive. If multiple directives on the
 * same element request a new scope, only one new scope is created. The new scope rule does not
 * apply for the root of the template since the root of the template always gets a new scope.
 *
 * **If set to `{}` (object hash),** then a new "isolate" scope is created. The 'isolate' scope differs from
 * normal scope in that it does not prototypically inherit from the parent scope. This is useful
 * when creating reusable components, which should not accidentally read or modify data in the
 * parent scope.
 *
 * The 'isolate' scope takes an object hash which defines a set of local scope properties
 * derived from the parent scope. These local properties are useful for aliasing values for
 * templates. Locals definition is a hash of local scope property to its source:
 *
 * * `@` or `@attr` - bind a local scope property to the value of DOM attribute. The result is
 *   always a string since DOM attributes are strings. If no `attr` name is specified  then the
 *   attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.
 *   Given `<widget my-attr="hello {{name}}">` and widget definition
 *   of `scope: { localName:'@myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localName` will reflect
 *   the interpolated value of `hello {{name}}`. As the `name` attribute changes so will the
 *   `localName` property on the widget scope. The `name` is read from the parent scope (not
 *   component scope).
 *
 * * `=` or `=attr` - set up bi-directional binding between a local scope property and the
 *   parent scope property of name defined via the value of the `attr` attribute. If no `attr`
 *   name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.
 *   Given `<widget my-attr="parentModel">` and widget definition of
 *   `scope: { localModel:'=myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localModel` will reflect the
 *   value of `parentModel` on the parent scope. Any changes to `parentModel` will be reflected
 *   in `localModel` and any changes in `localModel` will reflect in `parentModel`. If the parent
 *   scope property doesn't exist, it will throw a NON_ASSIGNABLE_MODEL_EXPRESSION exception. You
 *   can avoid this behavior using `=?` or `=?attr` in order to flag the property as optional.
 *
 * * `&` or `&attr` - provides a way to execute an expression in the context of the parent scope.
 *   If no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the
 *   local name. Given `<widget my-attr="count = count + value">` and widget definition of
 *   `scope: { localFn:'&myAttr' }`, then isolate scope property `localFn` will point to
 *   a function wrapper for the `count = count + value` expression. Often it's desirable to
 *   pass data from the isolated scope via an expression and to the parent scope, this can be
 *   done by passing a map of local variable names and values into the expression wrapper fn.
 *   For example, if the expression is `increment(amount)` then we can specify the amount value
 *   by calling the `localFn` as `localFn({amount: 22})`.
 *
 *
 *
 * #### `controller`
 * Controller constructor function. The controller is instantiated before the
 * pre-linking phase and it is shared with other directives (see
 * `require` attribute). This allows the directives to communicate with each other and augment
 * each other's behavior. The controller is injectable (and supports bracket notation) with the following locals:
 *
 * * `$scope` - Current scope associated with the element
 * * `$element` - Current element
 * * `$attrs` - Current attributes object for the element
 * * `$transclude` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.
 *    The scope can be overridden by an optional first argument.
 *   `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn)`.
 *
 *
 * #### `require`
 * Require another directive and inject its controller as the fourth argument to the linking function. The
 * `require` takes a string name (or array of strings) of the directive(s) to pass in. If an array is used, the
 * injected argument will be an array in corresponding order. If no such directive can be
 * found, or if the directive does not have a controller, then an error is raised. The name can be prefixed with:
 *
 * * (no prefix) - Locate the required controller on the current element. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `?` - Attempt to locate the required controller or pass `null` to the `link` fn if not found.
 * * `^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element's parents. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `?^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element's parents or pass `null` to the
 *   `link` fn if not found.
 *
 *
 * #### `controllerAs`
 * Controller alias at the directive scope. An alias for the controller so it
 * can be referenced at the directive template. The directive needs to define a scope for this
 * configuration to be used. Useful in the case when directive is used as component.
 *
 *
 * #### `restrict`
 * String of subset of `EACM` which restricts the directive to a specific directive
 * declaration style. If omitted, the default (attributes only) is used.
 *
 * * `E` - Element name: `<my-directive></my-directive>`
 * * `A` - Attribute (default): `<div my-directive="exp"></div>`
 * * `C` - Class: `<div class="my-directive: exp;"></div>`
 * * `M` - Comment: `<!-- directive: my-directive exp -->`
 *
 *
 * #### `template`
 * replace the current element with the contents of the HTML. The replacement process
 * migrates all of the attributes / classes from the old element to the new one. See the
 * {@link guide/directive#creating-custom-directives_creating-directives_template-expanding-directive
 * Directives Guide} for an example.
 *
 * You can specify `template` as a string representing the template or as a function which takes
 * two arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile` function api below) and
 * returns a string value representing the template.
 *
 *
 * #### `templateUrl`
 * Same as `template` but the template is loaded from the specified URL. Because
 * the template loading is asynchronous the compilation/linking is suspended until the template
 * is loaded.
 *
 * You can specify `templateUrl` as a string representing the URL or as a function which takes two
 * arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile` function api below) and returns
 * a string value representing the url.  In either case, the template URL is passed through {@link
 * api/ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl}.
 *
 *
 * #### `replace` ([*DEPRECATED*!], will be removed in next major release)
 * specify where the template should be inserted. Defaults to `false`.
 *
 * * `true` - the template will replace the current element.
 * * `false` - the template will replace the contents of the current element.
 *
 *
 * #### `transclude`
 * compile the content of the element and make it available to the directive.
 * Typically used with {@link ng.directive:ngTransclude
 * ngTransclude}. The advantage of transclusion is that the linking function receives a
 * transclusion function which is pre-bound to the correct scope. In a typical setup the widget
 * creates an `isolate` scope, but the transclusion is not a child, but a sibling of the `isolate`
 * scope. This makes it possible for the widget to have private state, and the transclusion to
 * be bound to the parent (pre-`isolate`) scope.
 *
 * * `true` - transclude the content of the directive.
 * * `'element'` - transclude the whole element including any directives defined at lower priority.
 *
 *
 * #### `compile`
 *
 * ```js
 *   function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * The compile function deals with transforming the template DOM. Since most directives do not do
 * template transformation, it is not used often. The compile function takes the following arguments:
 *
 *   * `tElement` - template element - The element where the directive has been declared. It is
 *     safe to do template transformation on the element and child elements only.
 *
 *   * `tAttrs` - template attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared
 *     between all directive compile functions.
 *
 *   * `transclude` -  [*DEPRECATED*!] A transclude linking function: `function(scope, cloneLinkingFn)`
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** The template instance and the link instance may be different objects if the template has
 * been cloned. For this reason it is **not** safe to do anything other than DOM transformations that
 * apply to all cloned DOM nodes within the compile function. Specifically, DOM listener registration
 * should be done in a linking function rather than in a compile function.
 * </div>

 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** The compile function cannot handle directives that recursively use themselves in their
 * own templates or compile functions. Compiling these directives results in an infinite loop and a
 * stack overflow errors.
 *
 * This can be avoided by manually using $compile in the postLink function to imperatively compile
 * a directive's template instead of relying on automatic template compilation via `template` or
 * `templateUrl` declaration or manual compilation inside the compile function.
 * </div>
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-error">
 * **Note:** The `transclude` function that is passed to the compile function is deprecated, as it
 *   e.g. does not know about the right outer scope. Please use the transclude function that is passed
 *   to the link function instead.
 * </div>

 * A compile function can have a return value which can be either a function or an object.
 *
 * * returning a (post-link) function - is equivalent to registering the linking function via the
 *   `link` property of the config object when the compile function is empty.
 *
 * * returning an object with function(s) registered via `pre` and `post` properties - allows you to
 *   control when a linking function should be called during the linking phase. See info about
 *   pre-linking and post-linking functions below.
 *
 *
 * #### `link`
 * This property is used only if the `compile` property is not defined.
 *
 * ```js
 *   function link(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller, transcludeFn) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * The link function is responsible for registering DOM listeners as well as updating the DOM. It is
 * executed after the template has been cloned. This is where most of the directive logic will be
 * put.
 *
 *   * `scope` - {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} - The scope to be used by the
 *     directive for registering {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches}.
 *
 *   * `iElement` - instance element - The element where the directive is to be used. It is safe to
 *     manipulate the children of the element only in `postLink` function since the children have
 *     already been linked.
 *
 *   * `iAttrs` - instance attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared
 *     between all directive linking functions.
 *
 *   * `controller` - a controller instance - A controller instance if at least one directive on the
 *     element defines a controller. The controller is shared among all the directives, which allows
 *     the directives to use the controllers as a communication channel.
 *
 *   * `transcludeFn` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.
 *     The scope can be overridden by an optional first argument. This is the same as the `$transclude`
 *     parameter of directive controllers.
 *     `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn)`.
 *
 *
 * #### Pre-linking function
 *
 * Executed before the child elements are linked. Not safe to do DOM transformation since the
 * compiler linking function will fail to locate the correct elements for linking.
 *
 * #### Post-linking function
 *
 * Executed after the child elements are linked. It is safe to do DOM transformation in the post-linking function.
 *
 * <a name="Attributes"></a>
 * ### Attributes
 *
 * The {@link ng.$compile.directive.Attributes Attributes} object - passed as a parameter in the
 * `link()` or `compile()` functions. It has a variety of uses.
 *
 * accessing *Normalized attribute names:*
 * Directives like 'ngBind' can be expressed in many ways: 'ng:bind', `data-ng-bind`, or 'x-ng-bind'.
 * the attributes object allows for normalized access to
 *   the attributes.
 *
 * * *Directive inter-communication:* All directives share the same instance of the attributes
 *   object which allows the directives to use the attributes object as inter directive
 *   communication.
 *
 * * *Supports interpolation:* Interpolation attributes are assigned to the attribute object
 *   allowing other directives to read the interpolated value.
 *
 * * *Observing interpolated attributes:* Use `$observe` to observe the value changes of attributes
 *   that contain interpolation (e.g. `src="{{bar}}"`). Not only is this very efficient but it's also
 *   the only way to easily get the actual value because during the linking phase the interpolation
 *   hasn't been evaluated yet and so the value is at this time set to `undefined`.
 *
 * ```js
 * function linkingFn(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {
 *   // get the attribute value
 *   console.log(attrs.ngModel);
 *
 *   // change the attribute
 *   attrs.$set('ngModel', 'new value');
 *
 *   // observe changes to interpolated attribute
 *   attrs.$observe('ngModel', function(value) {
 *     console.log('ngModel has changed value to ' + value);
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Below is an example using `$compileProvider`.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note**: Typically directives are registered with `module.directive`. The example below is
 * to illustrate how `$compile` works.
 * </div>
 *

 *
 * @param {string|DOMElement} element Element or HTML string to compile into a template function.
 * @param {function(angular.Scope, cloneAttachFn=)} transclude function available to directives.
 * @param {number} maxPriority only apply directives lower than given priority (Only effects the
 *                 root element(s), not their children)
 * @returns {function(scope, cloneAttachFn=)} a link function which is used to bind template
 * (a DOM element/tree) to a scope. Where:
 *
 *  * `scope` - A {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} to bind to.
 *  * `cloneAttachFn` - If `cloneAttachFn` is provided, then the link function will clone the
 *  `template` and call the `cloneAttachFn` function allowing the caller to attach the
 *  cloned elements to the DOM document at the appropriate place. The `cloneAttachFn` is
 *  called as: <br> `cloneAttachFn(clonedElement, scope)` where:
 *
 *      * `clonedElement` - is a clone of the original `element` passed into the compiler.
 *      * `scope` - is the current scope with which the linking function is working with.
 *
 * Calling the linking function returns the element of the template. It is either the original
 * element passed in, or the clone of the element if the `cloneAttachFn` is provided.
 *
 * After linking the view is not updated until after a call to $digest which typically is done by
 * Angular automatically.
 *
 * If you need access to the bound view, there are two ways to do it:
 *
 * - If you are not asking the linking function to clone the template, create the DOM element(s)
 *   before you send them to the compiler and keep this reference around.
 *   ```js
 *     var element = $compile('<p>{{total}}</p>')(scope);
 *   ```
 *
 * - if on the other hand, you need the element to be cloned, the view reference from the original
 *   example would not point to the clone, but rather to the original template that was cloned. In
 *   this case, you can access the clone via the cloneAttachFn:
 *   ```js
 *     var templateElement = angular.element('<p>{{total}}</p>'),
 *         scope = ....;
 *
 *     var clonedElement = $compile(templateElement)(scope, function(clonedElement, scope) {
 *       //attach the clone to DOM document at the right place
 *     });
 *
 *     //now we have reference to the cloned DOM via `clonedElement`
 *   ```
 *
 *
 * For information on how the compiler works, see the
 * {@link guide/compiler Angular HTML Compiler} section of the Developer Guide.

     * that is used to generate an HTTP request and returns  a {@link ng.$q promise}
     * with two $http specific methods: `success` and `error`.
     *
     * ```js
     *   $http({method: 'GET', url: '/someUrl'}).
     *     success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously
     *       // when the response is available
     *     }).
     *     error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs
     *       // or server returns response with an error status.
     *     });
     * ```
     *
     * Since the returned value of calling the $http function is a `promise`, you can also use
     * the `then` method to register callbacks, and these callbacks will receive a single argument –
     * an object representing the response. See the API signature and type info below for more
     * details.
     *
     * A response status code between 200 and 299 is considered a success status and
     * will result in the success callback being called. Note that if the response is a redirect,
     * XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning that the error callback will not be
     * called for such responses.
     *
     * # Writing Unit Tests that use $http
     * When unit testing (using {@link ngMock ngMock}), it is necessary to call
     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend#flush $httpBackend.flush()} to flush each pending
     * request using trained responses.
     *
     * ```
     * $httpBackend.expectGET(...);
     * $http.get(...);
     * $httpBackend.flush();
     * ```
     *
     * # Shortcut methods
     *
     * Shortcut methods are also available. All shortcut methods require passing in the URL, and
     * request data must be passed in for POST/PUT requests.
     *
     * ```js
     *   $http.get('/someUrl').success(successCallback);
     *   $http.post('/someUrl', data).success(successCallback);
     * ```
     *
     * Complete list of shortcut methods:
     *
     * - {@link ng.$http#get $http.get}
     * - {@link ng.$http#head $http.head}
     * - {@link ng.$http#post $http.post}
     * - {@link ng.$http#put $http.put}
     * - {@link ng.$http#delete $http.delete}
     * - {@link ng.$http#jsonp $http.jsonp}
     *
     *
     * # Setting HTTP Headers
     *
     * The $http service will automatically add certain HTTP headers to all requests. These defaults
     * can be fully configured by accessing the `$httpProvider.defaults.headers` configuration
     * object, which currently contains this default configuration:
     *
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common` (headers that are common for all requests):
     *   - `Accept: application/json, text/plain, * / *`
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.post`: (header defaults for POST requests)
     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.put` (header defaults for PUT requests)
     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`
     *
     * To add or overwrite these defaults, simply add or remove a property from these configuration
     * objects. To add headers for an HTTP method other than POST or PUT, simply add a new object
     * with the lowercased HTTP method name as the key, e.g.
     * `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.get = { 'My-Header' : 'value' }.
     *
     * The defaults can also be set at runtime via the `$http.defaults` object in the same
     * fashion. For example:
     *
     * ```
     * module.run(function($http) {
     *   $http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Basic YmVlcDpib29w'
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * In addition, you can supply a `headers` property in the config object passed when
     * calling `$http(config)`, which overrides the defaults without changing them globally.
     *
     *
     * # Transforming Requests and Responses
     *
     * Both requests and responses can be transformed using transform functions. By default, Angular
     * applies these transformations:
     *
     * Request transformations:
     *
     * - If the `data` property of the request configuration object contains an object, serialize it
     *   into JSON format.
     *
     * Response transformations:
     *
     *  - If XSRF prefix is detected, strip it (see Security Considerations section below).
     *  - If JSON response is detected, deserialize it using a JSON parser.
     *
     * To globally augment or override the default transforms, modify the
     * `$httpProvider.defaults.transformRequest` and `$httpProvider.defaults.transformResponse`
     * properties. These properties are by default an array of transform functions, which allows you
     * to `push` or `unshift` a new transformation function into the transformation chain. You can
     * also decide to completely override any default transformations by assigning your
     * transformation functions to these properties directly without the array wrapper.  These defaults
     * are again available on the $http factory at run-time, which may be useful if you have run-time
     * services you wish to be involved in your transformations.
     *
     * Similarly, to locally override the request/response transforms, augment the
     * `transformRequest` and/or `transformResponse` properties of the configuration object passed
     * into `$http`.
     *
     *
     * # Caching
     *
     * To enable caching, set the request configuration `cache` property to `true` (to use default
     * cache) or to a custom cache object (built with {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}).
     * When the cache is enabled, `$http` stores the response from the server in the specified
     * cache. The next time the same request is made, the response is served from the cache without
     * sending a request to the server.
     *
     * Note that even if the response is served from cache, delivery of the data is asynchronous in
     * the same way that real requests are.
     *
     * If there are multiple GET requests for the same URL that should be cached using the same
     * cache, but the cache is not populated yet, only one request to the server will be made and
     * the remaining requests will be fulfilled using the response from the first request.
     *
     * You can change the default cache to a new object (built with
     * {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}) by updating the
     * {@link ng.$http#properties_defaults `$http.defaults.cache`} property. All requests who set
     * their `cache` property to `true` will now use this cache object.
     *
     * If you set the default cache to `false` then only requests that specify their own custom
     * cache object will be cached.
     *
     * # Interceptors
     *
     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the
     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.
     *
     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication, or any kind of synchronous or
     * asynchronous pre-processing of request or postprocessing of responses, it is desirable to be
     * able to intercept requests before they are handed to the server and
     * responses before they are handed over to the application code that
     * initiated these requests. The interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q
     * promise APIs} to fulfill this need for both synchronous and asynchronous pre-processing.
     *
     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the `$httpProvider` by
     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.interceptors` array. The factory is called and
     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor.
     *
     * There are two kinds of interceptors (and two kinds of rejection interceptors):
     *
     *   * `request`: interceptors get called with a http `config` object. The function is free to
     *     modify the `config` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `config`
     *     object directly, or a promise containing the `config` or a new `config` object.
     *   * `requestError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or
     *     resolved with a rejection.
     *   * `response`: interceptors get called with http `response` object. The function is free to
     *     modify the `response` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `response`
     *     object directly, or as a promise containing the `response` or a new `response` object.
     *   * `responseError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or
     *     resolved with a rejection.
     *
     *
     * ```js
     *   // register the interceptor as a service
     *   $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return {
     *       // optional method
     *       'request': function(config) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return config;
     *       },
     *
     *       // optional method
     *      'requestError': function(rejection) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(rejection);
     *       },
     *
     *
     *
     *       // optional method
     *       'response': function(response) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return response;
     *       },
     *
     *       // optional method
     *      'responseError': function(rejection) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(rejection);
     *       }
     *     };
     *   });
     *
     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
     *
     *
     *   // alternatively, register the interceptor via an anonymous factory
     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return {
     *      'request': function(config) {
     *          // same as above
     *       },
     *
     *       'response': function(response) {
     *          // same as above
     *       }
     *     };
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     * # Response interceptors (DEPRECATED)
     *
     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the
     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.
     *
     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication or any kind of synchronous or
     * asynchronous preprocessing of received responses, it is desirable to be able to intercept
     * responses for http requests before they are handed over to the application code that
     * initiated these requests. The response interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q
     * promise apis} to fulfil this need for both synchronous and asynchronous preprocessing.
     *
     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the $httpProvider by
     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.responseInterceptors` array. The factory is called and
     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor  — a function that
     * takes a {@link ng.$q promise} and returns the original or a new promise.
     *
     * ```js
     *   // register the interceptor as a service
     *   $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return function(promise) {
     *       return promise.then(function(response) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return response;
     *       }, function(response) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(response)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(response);
     *       });
     *     }
     *   });
     *
     *   $httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
     *
     *
     *   // register the interceptor via an anonymous factory
     *   $httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push(function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return function(promise) {
     *       // same as above
     *     }
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * # Security Considerations
     *
     * When designing web applications, consider security threats from:
     *
     * - [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)
     * - [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
     *
     * Both server and the client must cooperate in order to eliminate these threats. Angular comes
     * pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend server
     * cooperation is required.
     *
     * ## JSON Vulnerability Protection
     *
     * A [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)
     * allows third party website to turn your JSON resource URL into
     * [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) request under some conditions. To
     * counter this your server can prefix all JSON requests with following string `")]}',\n"`.
     * Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.
     *
     * For example if your server needs to return:
     * ```js
     * ['one','two']
     * ```
     *
     * which is vulnerable to attack, your server can return:
     * ```js
     * )]}',
     * ['one','two']
     * ```
     *
     * Angular will strip the prefix, before processing the JSON.
     *
     *
     * ## Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Protection
     *
     * [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is a technique by which
     * an unauthorized site can gain your user's private data. Angular provides a mechanism
     * to counter XSRF. When performing XHR requests, the $http service reads a token from a cookie
     * (by default, `XSRF-TOKEN`) and sets it as an HTTP header (`X-XSRF-TOKEN`). Since only
     * JavaScript that runs on your domain could read the cookie, your server can be assured that
     * the XHR came from JavaScript running on your domain. The header will not be set for
     * cross-domain requests.
     *
     * To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session
     * cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on the first HTTP GET request. On subsequent XHR requests the
     * server can verify that the cookie matches `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure
     * that only JavaScript running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be
     * unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript from
     * making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's
     * authentication cookie with a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography))
     * for added security.
     *
     * The name of the headers can be specified using the xsrfHeaderName and xsrfCookieName
     * properties of either $httpProvider.defaults at config-time, $http.defaults at run-time,
     * or the per-request config object.
     *
     *
     * @param {object} config Object describing the request to be made and how it should be
     *    processed. The object has following properties:
     *
     *    - **method** – `{string}` – HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'POST', etc)
     *    - **url** – `{string}` – Absolute or relative URL of the resource that is being requested.
     *    - **params** – `{Object.<string|Object>}` – Map of strings or objects which will be turned
     *      to `?key1=value1&key2=value2` after the url. If the value is not a string, it will be
     *      JSONified.
     *    - **data** – `{string|Object}` – Data to be sent as the request message data.
     *    - **headers** – `{Object}` – Map of strings or functions which return strings representing
     *      HTTP headers to send to the server. If the return value of a function is null, the
     *      header will not be sent.
     *    - **xsrfHeaderName** – `{string}` – Name of HTTP header to populate with the XSRF token.
     *    - **xsrfCookieName** – `{string}` – Name of cookie containing the XSRF token.
     *    - **transformRequest** –
     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
     *      request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.
     *    - **transformResponse** –
     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
     *      response body and headers and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.
     *    - **cache** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the
     *      GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with
     *      {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for
     *      caching.
     *    - **timeout** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise}
     *      that should abort the request when resolved.
     *    - **withCredentials** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the
     *      XHR object. See [requests with credentials]https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control#section_5
     *      for more information.
     *    - **responseType** - `{string}` - see
     *      [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).
     *
     * @returns {HttpPromise} Returns a {@link ng.$q promise} object with the
     *   standard `then` method and two http specific methods: `success` and `error`. The `then`
     *   method takes two arguments a success and an error callback which will be called with a
     *   response object. The `success` and `error` methods take a single argument - a function that
     *   will be called when the request succeeds or fails respectively. The arguments passed into
     *   these functions are destructured representation of the response object passed into the
     *   `then` method. The response object has these properties:
     *
     *   - **data** – `{string|Object}` – The response body transformed with the transform
     *     functions.
     *   - **status** – `{number}` – HTTP status code of the response.
     *   - **headers** – `{function([headerName])}` – Header getter function.
     *   - **config** – `{Object}` – The configuration object that was used to generate the request.
     *   - **statusText** – `{string}` – HTTP status text of the response.
     *
     * @property {Array.<Object>} pendingRequests Array of config objects for currently pending
     *   requests. This is primarily meant to be used for debugging purposes.

      *
      * @description
      * Angular's wrapper for `window.setInterval`. The `fn` function is executed every `delay`
      * milliseconds.
      *
      * The return value of registering an interval function is a promise. This promise will be
      * notified upon each tick of the interval, and will be resolved after `count` iterations, or
      * run indefinitely if `count` is not defined. The value of the notification will be the
      * number of iterations that have run.
      * To cancel an interval, call `$interval.cancel(promise)`.
      *
      * In tests you can use {@link ngMock.$interval#flush `$interval.flush(millis)`} to
      * move forward by `millis` milliseconds and trigger any functions scheduled to run in that
      * time.
      *
      * <div class="alert alert-warning">
      * **Note**: Intervals created by this service must be explicitly destroyed when you are finished
      * with them.  In particular they are not automatically destroyed when a controller's scope or a
      * directive's element are destroyed.
      * You should take this into consideration and make sure to always cancel the interval at the
      * appropriate moment.  See the example below for more details on how and when to do this.
      * </div>
      *
      * @param {function()} fn A function that should be called repeatedly.
      * @param {number} delay Number of milliseconds between each function call.
      * @param {number=} [count=0] Number of times to repeat. If not set, or 0, will repeat
      *   indefinitely.
      * @param {boolean=} [invokeApply=true] If set to `false` skips model dirty checking, otherwise
      *   will invoke `fn` within the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply} block.
      * @returns {promise} A promise which will be notified on each iteration.

// Sandboxing Angular Expressions
// ------------------------------
// Angular expressions are generally considered safe because these expressions only have direct
// access to $scope and locals. However, one can obtain the ability to execute arbitrary JS code by
// obtaining a reference to native JS functions such as the Function constructor.
//
// As an example, consider the following Angular expression:
//
//   {}.toString.constructor(alert("evil JS code"))
//
// We want to prevent this type of access. For the sake of performance, during the lexing phase we
// disallow any "dotted" access to any member named "constructor".
//
// For reflective calls (a[b]) we check that the value of the lookup is not the Function constructor
// while evaluating the expression, which is a stronger but more expensive test. Since reflective
// calls are expensive anyway, this is not such a big deal compared to static dereferencing.
//
// This sandboxing technique is not perfect and doesn't aim to be. The goal is to prevent exploits
// against the expression language, but not to prevent exploits that were enabled by exposing
// sensitive JavaScript or browser apis on Scope. Exposing such objects on a Scope is never a good
// practice and therefore we are not even trying to protect against interaction with an object
// explicitly exposed in this way.
//
// A developer could foil the name check by aliasing the Function constructor under a different
// name on the scope.
//
// In general, it is not possible to access a Window object from an angular expression unless a
// window or some DOM object that has a reference to window is published onto a Scope.

   *
   * **This feature is deprecated, see deprecation notes below for more info**
   *
   * If set to true (default is false), $parse will unwrap promises automatically when a promise is
   * found at any part of the expression. In other words, if set to true, the expression will always
   * result in a non-promise value.
   *
   * While the promise is unresolved, it's treated as undefined, but once resolved and fulfilled,
   * the fulfillment value is used in place of the promise while evaluating the expression.
   *
   * **Deprecation notice**
   *
   * This is a feature that didn't prove to be wildly useful or popular, primarily because of the
   * dichotomy between data access in templates (accessed as raw values) and controller code
   * (accessed as promises).
   *
   * In most code we ended up resolving promises manually in controllers anyway and thus unifying
   * the model access there.
   *
   * Other downsides of automatic promise unwrapping:
   *
   * - when building components it's often desirable to receive the raw promises
   * - adds complexity and slows down expression evaluation
   * - makes expression code pre-generation unattractive due to the amount of code that needs to be
   *   generated
   * - makes IDE auto-completion and tool support hard
   *
   * **Warning Logs**
   *
   * If the unwrapping is enabled, Angular will log a warning about each expression that unwraps a
   * promise (to reduce the noise, each expression is logged only once). To disable this logging use
   * `$parseProvider.logPromiseWarnings(false)` api.
   *
   *
   * @param {boolean=} value New value.
   * @returns {boolean|self} Returns the current setting when used as getter and self if used as
   *                         setter.

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $q
 * @requires $rootScope
 *
 * @description
 * A promise/deferred implementation inspired by [Kris Kowal's Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).
 *
 * [The CommonJS Promise proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) describes a promise as an
 * interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is
 * performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.
 *
 * From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to
 * asynchronous programming what `try`, `catch` and `throw` keywords are to synchronous programming.
 *
 * ```js
 *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q`, `scope` and `okToGreet`
 *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).
 *
 *   function asyncGreet(name) {
 *     var deferred = $q.defer();
 *
 *     setTimeout(function() {
 *       // since this fn executes async in a future turn of the event loop, we need to wrap
 *       // our code into an $apply call so that the model changes are properly observed.
 *       scope.$apply(function() {
 *         deferred.notify('About to greet ' + name + '.');
 *
 *         if (okToGreet(name)) {
 *           deferred.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
 *         } else {
 *           deferred.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
 *         }
 *       });
 *     }, 1000);
 *
 *     return deferred.promise;
 *   }
 *
 *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
 *   promise.then(function(greeting) {
 *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);
 *   }, function(reason) {
 *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);
 *   }, function(update) {
 *     alert('Got notification: ' + update);
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * At first it might not be obvious why this extra complexity is worth the trouble. The payoff
 * comes in the way of guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make, see
 * https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md.
 *
 * Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the
 * traditional callback ([CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)) approach.
 * For more on this please see the [Q documentation](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) especially the
 * section on serial or parallel joining of promises.
 *
 *
 * # The Deferred API
 *
 * A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling `$q.defer()`.
 *
 * The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs
 * that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion, as well as the status
 * of the task.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `resolve(value)` – resolves the derived promise with the `value`. If the value is a rejection
 *   constructed via `$q.reject`, the promise will be rejected instead.
 * - `reject(reason)` – rejects the derived promise with the `reason`. This is equivalent to
 *   resolving it with a rejection constructed via `$q.reject`.
 * - `notify(value)` - provides updates on the status of the promise's execution. This may be called
 *   multiple times before the promise is either resolved or rejected.
 *
 * **Properties**
 *
 * - promise – `{Promise}` – promise object associated with this deferred.
 *
 *
 * # The Promise API
 *
 * A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by
 * calling `deferred.promise`.
 *
 * The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result
 * of the deferred task when it completes.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `then(successCallback, errorCallback, notifyCallback)` – regardless of when the promise was or
 *   will be resolved or rejected, `then` calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously
 *   as soon as the result is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument: the result
 *   or rejection reason. Additionally, the notify callback may be called zero or more times to
 *   provide a progress indication, before the promise is resolved or rejected.
 *
 *   This method *returns a new promise* which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the
 *   `successCallback`, `errorCallback`. It also notifies via the return value of the
 *   `notifyCallback` method. The promise can not be resolved or rejected from the notifyCallback
 *   method.
 *
 * - `catch(errorCallback)` – shorthand for `promise.then(null, errorCallback)`
 *
 * - `finally(callback)` – allows you to observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise,
 *   but to do so without modifying the final value. This is useful to release resources or do some
 *   clean-up that needs to be done whether the promise was rejected or resolved. See the [full
 *   specification](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promisefinallycallback) for
 *   more information.
 *
 *   Because `finally` is a reserved word in JavaScript and reserved keywords are not supported as
 *   property names by ES3, you'll need to invoke the method like `promise['finally'](callback)` to
 *   make your code IE8 and Android 2.x compatible.
 *
 * # Chaining promises
 *
 * Because calling the `then` method of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily
 * possible to create a chain of promises:
 *
 * ```js
 *   promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {
 *     return result + 1;
 *   });
 *
 *   // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value
 *   // will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1
 * ```
 *
 * It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another
 * promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of
 * the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful APIs like
 * $http's response interceptors.
 *
 *
 * # Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q
 *
 *  There are two main differences:
 *
 * - $q is integrated with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope} Scope model observation
 *   mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your
 *   models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.
 * - Q has many more features than $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains
 *   all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.
 *
 *  # Testing
 *
 *  ```js
 *    it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {
 *      var deferred = $q.defer();
 *      var promise = deferred.promise;
 *      var resolvedValue;
 *
 *      promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 *
 *      // Simulate resolving of promise
 *      deferred.resolve(123);
 *      // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.
 *      // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not
 *      // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 *
 *      // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().
 *      $rootScope.$apply();
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);
 *    }));
 *  ```

/**
 * DESIGN NOTES
 *
 * The design decisions behind the scope are heavily favored for speed and memory consumption.
 *
 * The typical use of scope is to watch the expressions, which most of the time return the same
 * value as last time so we optimize the operation.
 *
 * Closures construction is expensive in terms of speed as well as memory:
 *   - No closures, instead use prototypical inheritance for API
 *   - Internal state needs to be stored on scope directly, which means that private state is
 *     exposed as $$____ properties
 *
 * Loop operations are optimized by using while(count--) { ... }
 *   - this means that in order to keep the same order of execution as addition we have to add
 *     items to the array at the beginning (unshift) instead of at the end (push)
 *
 * Child scopes are created and removed often
 *   - Using an array would be slow since inserts in middle are expensive so we use linked list
 *
 * There are few watches then a lot of observers. This is why you don't want the observer to be
 * implemented in the same way as watch. Watch requires return of initialization function which
 * are expensive to construct.

       *
       * @description
       * Registers a `listener` callback to be executed whenever the `watchExpression` changes.
       *
       * - The `watchExpression` is called on every call to {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest
       *   $digest()} and should return the value that will be watched. (Since
       *   {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} reruns when it detects changes the
       *   `watchExpression` can execute multiple times per
       *   {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} and should be idempotent.)
       * - The `listener` is called only when the value from the current `watchExpression` and the
       *   previous call to `watchExpression` are not equal (with the exception of the initial run,
       *   see below). Inequality is determined according to reference inequality,
       *   [strict comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)
       *    via the `!==` Javascript operator, unless `objectEquality == true`
       *   (see next point)
       * - When `objectEquality == true`, inequality of the `watchExpression` is determined
       *   according to the {@link angular.equals} function. To save the value of the object for
       *   later comparison, the {@link angular.copy} function is used. This therefore means that
       *   watching complex objects will have adverse memory and performance implications.
       * - The watch `listener` may change the model, which may trigger other `listener`s to fire.
       *   This is achieved by rerunning the watchers until no changes are detected. The rerun
       *   iteration limit is 10 to prevent an infinite loop deadlock.
       *
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with no `listener`. (Since `watchExpression`
       * can execute multiple times per {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} cycle when a
       * change is detected, be prepared for multiple calls to your listener.)
       *
       * After a watcher is registered with the scope, the `listener` fn is called asynchronously
       * (via {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync $evalAsync}) to initialize the
       * watcher. In rare cases, this is undesirable because the listener is called when the result
       * of `watchExpression` didn't change. To detect this scenario within the `listener` fn, you
       * can compare the `newVal` and `oldVal`. If these two values are identical (`===`) then the
       * listener was called due to initialization.
       *
       * The example below contains an illustration of using a function as your $watch listener
       *
       *
       * # Example
       * ```js
           // let's assume that scope was dependency injected as the $rootScope

           scope.name = 'misko';

             scope.counter = scope.counter + 1;
           });
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);

           scope.$digest();
           // the listener is always called during the first $digest loop after it was registered
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

           scope.$digest();
           // but now it will not be called unless the value changes

       * @ngdoc method
       * @name $rootScope.Scope#$digest
       * @kind function
       *
       * @description
       * Processes all of the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers} of the current scope and
       * its children. Because a {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watcher}'s listener can change
       * the model, the `$digest()` keeps calling the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers}
       * until no more listeners are firing. This means that it is possible to get into an infinite
       * loop. This function will throw `'Maximum iteration limit exceeded.'` if the number of
       * iterations exceeds 10.
       *
       * Usually, you don't call `$digest()` directly in
       * {@link ng.directive:ngController controllers} or in
       * {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}.
       * Instead, you should call {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply()} (typically from within
       * a {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}), which will force a `$digest()`.
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever `$digest()` is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with
       * {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch()} with no `listener`.
       *
       * In unit tests, you may need to call `$digest()` to simulate the scope life cycle.
       *
       * # Example
       * ```js
           var scope = ...;
           scope.name = 'misko';
           scope.counter = 0;

           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);
           scope.$watch('name', function(newValue, oldValue) {
             scope.counter = scope.counter + 1;
           });
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);

           scope.$digest();
           // the listener is always called during the first $digest loop after it was registered
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

           scope.$digest();
           // but now it will not be called unless the value changes
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

           scope.name = 'adam';

 * @description
 *
 * `$sceDelegate` is a service that is used by the `$sce` service to provide {@link ng.$sce Strict
 * Contextual Escaping (SCE)} services to AngularJS.
 *
 * Typically, you would configure or override the {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} instead of
 * the `$sce` service to customize the way Strict Contextual Escaping works in AngularJS.  This is
 * because, while the `$sce` provides numerous shorthand methods, etc., you really only need to
 * override 3 core functions (`trustAs`, `getTrusted` and `valueOf`) to replace the way things
 * work because `$sce` delegates to `$sceDelegate` for these operations.
 *
 * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} to configure this service.
 *
 * The default instance of `$sceDelegate` should work out of the box with little pain.  While you
 * can override it completely to change the behavior of `$sce`, the common case would
 * involve configuring the {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} instead by setting
 * your own whitelists and blacklists for trusting URLs used for loading AngularJS resources such as
 * templates.  Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist
 * $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist} and {@link

 * The `$sceDelegateProvider` provider allows developers to configure the {@link ng.$sceDelegate

 * that the URLs used for sourcing Angular templates are safe.  Refer {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist} and
 * {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlBlacklist}
 *
 * For the general details about this service in Angular, read the main page for {@link ng.$sce
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE)}.
 *
 * **Example**:  Consider the following case. <a name="example"></a>
 *
 * - your app is hosted at url `http://myapp.example.com/`
 * - but some of your templates are hosted on other domains you control such as
 *   `http://srv01.assets.example.com/`,  `http://srv02.assets.example.com/`, etc.
 * - and you have an open redirect at `http://myapp.example.com/clickThru?...`.
 *
 * Here is what a secure configuration for this scenario might look like:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *    angular.module('myApp', []).config(function($sceDelegateProvider) {
 *      $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist([
 *        // Allow same origin resource loads.
 *        'self',
 *        // Allow loading from our assets domain.  Notice the difference between * and **.
 *        'http://srv*.assets.example.com/**']);

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $sce
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 *
 * `$sce` is a service that provides Strict Contextual Escaping services to AngularJS.
 *
 * # Strict Contextual Escaping
 *
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS requires bindings in certain
 * contexts to result in a value that is marked as safe to use for that context.  One example of
 * such a context is binding arbitrary html controlled by the user via `ng-bind-html`.  We refer
 * to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.
 *
 * As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.
 *
 * Note:  When enabled (the default), IE8 in quirks mode is not supported.  In this mode, IE8 allows
 * one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use of the expression() syntax.  Refer
 * <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx> to learn more about them.
 * You can ensure your document is in standards mode and not quirks mode by adding `<!doctype html>`
 * to the top of your HTML document.
 *
 * SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for
 * security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.
 *
 * Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *     <input ng-model="userHtml">
 *     <div ng-bind-html="userHtml">
 * </pre>
 *
 * Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user.  With SCE
 * disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV.
 * In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via
 * bindings.  (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input creates
 * security vulnerabilities.)
 *
 * For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,
 * to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.
 *
 * How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that
 * was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you
 * ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some
 * properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?
 *
 * To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can
 * determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that
 * context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done
 * for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,
 * sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps
 * allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API
 * exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.
 *
 * In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}
 * (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to
 * obtain values that will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.
 *
 *
 * ## How does it work?
 *
 * In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted
 * $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly.  Directives use {@link
 * ng.$sce#parse $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs the
 * {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals.
 *
 * As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link
 * ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}.  Here's the actual code (slightly
 * simplified):
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *   var ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {
 *     return function(scope, element, attr) {
 *       scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {
 *         element.html(value || '');
 *       });
 *     };
 *   }];
 * </pre>
 *
 * ## Impact on loading templates
 *
 * This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as
 * `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.
 *
 * By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application
 * document.  This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl
 * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL.  To load templates from other domains and/or
 * protocols, you may either either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist
 * them} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap it} into a trusted value.
 *
 * *Please note*:
 * The browser's
 * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)
 * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)
 * policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully
 * loaded.  This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain
 * won't work on all browsers.  Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some
 * browsers.
 *
 * ## This feels like too much overhead for the developer?
 *
 * It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.
 *
 * If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to
 * call `$sce.trustAs` on them (remember to include the `ngSanitize` module) (e.g.
 * `<div ng-bind-html="'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'"></div>`) just works.
 *
 * Additionally, `a[href]` and `img[src]` automatically sanitize their URLs and do not pass them
 * through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted}.  SCE doesn't play a role here.
 *
 * The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load
 * templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.
 * It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https
 * served document.  You can change these by setting your own custom {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelists} and {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist blacklists} for matching such URLs.
 *
 * This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an
 * application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting
 * security onto an application later.
 *
 * <a name="contexts"></a>
 * ## What trusted context types are supported?
 *
 * | Context             | Notes          |
 * |---------------------|----------------|
 * | `$sce.HTML`         | For HTML that's safe to source into the application.  The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered and the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize} module is present this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |
 * | `$sce.CSS`          | For CSS that's safe to source into the application.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 * | `$sce.URL`          | For URLs that are safe to follow as links.  Currently unused (`<a href=` and `<img src=` sanitize their urls and don't constitute an SCE context. |
 * | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application.  Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.)  <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` does and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` are required. |
 * | `$sce.JS`           | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 *
 * ## Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist resourceUrlWhitelist}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist Blacklist} <a name="resourceUrlPatternItem"></a>
 *
 *  Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:
 *
 *  - **'self'**
 *    - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the **same
 *      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.
 *  - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)
 *    - The string is matched against the full *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource
 *      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)
 *    - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`.  All other characters
 *      match themselves.
 *    - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6
 *      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and ';'.  It's a useful wildcard for use
 *      in a whitelist.
 *    - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of *any* character.  As such, it's not
 *      not appropriate to use in for a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.
 *      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might
 *      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.
 *      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).
 *  - **RegExp** (*see caveat below*)
 *    - *Caveat*:  While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility,  their syntax
 *      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to
 *      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should
 *      have good test coverage.).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a
 *      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a
 *      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It
 *      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions
 *      if they as a last resort.
 *    - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.)  It is
 *      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested
 *      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags
 *      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.
 *    - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not
 *      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),
 *      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than
 *      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated
 *      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good
 *      enough before coding your own.  e.g. Ruby has
 *      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)
 *      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).
 *      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google
 *      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](
 *      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).
 *
 * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} for an example.

    By default, HTML that isn't explicitly trusted (e.g. Alice's comment) is sanitized when
    $sanitize is available.  If $sanitize isn't available, this results in an error instead of an
    exploit.
    <div class="well">
      <div ng-repeat="userComment in myCtrl.userComments">

 *
 * ## Can I disable SCE completely?
 *
 * Yes, you can.  However, this is strongly discouraged.  SCE gives you a lot of security benefits
 * for little coding overhead.  It will be much harder to take an SCE disabled application and
 * either secure it on your own or enable SCE at a later stage.  It might make sense to disable SCE
 * for cases where you have a lot of existing code that was written before SCE was introduced and
 * you're migrating them a module at a time.
 *
 * That said, here's how you can completely disable SCE:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *   angular.module('myAppWithSceDisabledmyApp', []).config(function($sceProvider) {
 *     // Completely disable SCE.  For demonstration purposes only!
 *     // Do not use in new projects.
 *     $sceProvider.enabled(false);
 *   });
 * </pre>

  /* Design notes on the default implementation for SCE.
   *
   * The API contract for the SCE delegate
   * -------------------------------------
   * The SCE delegate object must provide the following 3 methods:
   *
   * - trustAs(contextEnum, value)
   *     This method is used to tell the SCE service that the provided value is OK to use in the
   *     contexts specified by contextEnum.  It must return an object that will be accepted by
   *     getTrusted() for a compatible contextEnum and return this value.
   *
   * - valueOf(value)
   *     For values that were not produced by trustAs(), return them as is.  For values that were
   *     produced by trustAs(), return the corresponding input value to trustAs.  Basically, if
   *     trustAs is wrapping the given values into some type, this operation unwraps it when given
   *     such a value.
   *
   * - getTrusted(contextEnum, value)
   *     This function should return the a value that is safe to use in the context specified by
   *     contextEnum or throw and exception otherwise.
   *
   * NOTE: This contract deliberately does NOT state that values returned by trustAs() must be
   * opaque or wrapped in some holder object.  That happens to be an implementation detail.  For
   * instance, an implementation could maintain a registry of all trusted objects by context.  In
   * such a case, trustAs() would return the same object that was passed in.  getTrusted() would
   * return the same object passed in if it was found in the registry under a compatible context or
   * throw an exception otherwise.  An implementation might only wrap values some of the time based
   * on some criteria.  getTrusted() might return a value and not throw an exception for special
   * constants or objects even if not wrapped.  All such implementations fulfill this contract.
   *
   *
   * A note on the inheritance model for SCE contexts
   * ------------------------------------------------
   * I've used inheritance and made RESOURCE_URL wrapped types a subtype of URL wrapped types.  This
   * is purely an implementation details.
   *
   * The contract is simply this:
   *
   *     getTrusted($sce.RESOURCE_URL, value) succeeding implies that getTrusted($sce.URL, value)
   *     will also succeed.
   *
   * Inheritance happens to capture this in a natural way.  In some future, we
   * may not use inheritance anymore.  That is OK because no code outside of
   * sce.js and sceSpecs.js would need to be aware of this detail.

/**
 *
 * Implementation Notes for non-IE browsers
 * ----------------------------------------
 * Assigning a URL to the href property of an anchor DOM node, even one attached to the DOM,
 * results both in the normalizing and parsing of the URL.  Normalizing means that a relative
 * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.
 * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related
 * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide
 * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+, Opera 7+,e etc.  See
 * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html
 *
 * Implementation Notes for IE
 * ---------------------------
 * IE >= 8 and <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other
 * browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify
 * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = "foo", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We
 * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized
 * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the
 * properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.
 *
 * IE7 does not normalize the URL when assigned to an anchor node.  (Apparently, it does, if one
 * uses the inner HTML approach to assign the URL as part of an HTML snippet -
 * http://stackoverflow.com/a/472729)  However, setting img[src] does normalize the URL.
 * Unfortunately, setting img[src] to something like "javascript:foo" on IE throws an exception.
 * Since the primary usage for normalizing URLs is to sanitize such URLs, we can't use that
 * method and IE < 8 is unsupported.

/**
 * @ngdoc provider
 * @name $filterProvider
 * @description
 *
 * Filters are just functions which transform input to an output. However filters need to be
 * Dependency Injected. To achieve this a filter definition consists of a factory function which is
 * annotated with dependencies and is responsible for creating a filter function.
 *
 * ```js
 *   // Filter registration
 *   function MyModule($provide, $filterProvider) {
 *     // create a service to demonstrate injection (not always needed)
 *     $provide.value('greet', function(name){
 *       return 'Hello ' + name + '!';
 *     });
 *
 *     // register a filter factory which uses the
 *     // greet service to demonstrate DI.
 *     $filterProvider.register('greet', function(greet){
 *       // return the filter function which uses the greet service
 *       // to generate salutation
 *       return function(text) {
 *         // filters need to be forgiving so check input validity
 *         return text && greet(text) || text;
 *       };
 *     });
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * The filter function is registered with the `$injector` under the filter name suffix with
 * `Filter`.
 *
 * ```js
 *   it('should be the same instance', inject(
 *     function($filterProvider) {
 *       $filterProvider.register('reverse', function(){
 *         return ...;
 *       });
 *     },
 *     function($filter, reverseFilter) {
 *       expect($filter('reverse')).toBe(reverseFilter);
 *     });
 * ```
 *
 *
 * For more information about how angular filters work, and how to create your own filters, see
 * {@link guide/filter Filters} in the Angular Developer Guide.

/**
 * @ngdoc filter
 * @name filter
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Selects a subset of items from `array` and returns it as a new array.
 *
 * @param {Array} array The source array.
 * @param {string|Object|function()} expression The predicate to be used for selecting items from
 *   `array`.
 *
 *   Can be one of:
 *
 *   - `string`: The string is evaluated as an expression and the resulting value is used for substring match against
 *     the contents of the `array`. All strings or objects with string properties in `array` that contain this string
 *     will be returned. The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.
 *
 *   - `Object`: A pattern object can be used to filter specific properties on objects contained
 *     by `array`. For example `{name:"M", phone:"1"}` predicate will return an array of items
 *     which have property `name` containing "M" and property `phone` containing "1". A special
 *     property name `$` can be used (as in `{$:"text"}`) to accept a match against any
 *     property of the object. That's equivalent to the simple substring match with a `string`
 *     as described above.
 *
 *   - `function(value)`: A predicate function can be used to write arbitrary filters. The function is
 *     called for each element of `array`. The final result is an array of those elements that
 *     the predicate returned true for.
 *
 * @param {function(actual, expected)|true|undefined} comparator Comparator which is used in
 *     determining if the expected value (from the filter expression) and actual value (from
 *     the object in the array) should be considered a match.
 *
 *   Can be one of:
 *
 *   - `function(actual, expected)`:
 *     The function will be given the object value and the predicate value to compare and
 *     should return true if the item should be included in filtered result.
 *
 *   - `true`: A shorthand for `function(actual, expected) { return angular.equals(expected, actual)}`.
 *     this is essentially strict comparison of expected and actual.
 *
 *   - `false|undefined`: A short hand for a function which will look for a substring match in case
 *     insensitive way.
 *

/**
 * @ngdoc filter
 * @name date
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 *   Formats `date` to a string based on the requested `format`.
 *
 *   `format` string can be composed of the following elements:
 *
 *   * `'yyyy'`: 4 digit representation of year (e.g. AD 1 => 0001, AD 2010 => 2010)
 *   * `'yy'`: 2 digit representation of year, padded (00-99). (e.g. AD 2001 => 01, AD 2010 => 10)
 *   * `'y'`: 1 digit representation of year, e.g. (AD 1 => 1, AD 199 => 199)
 *   * `'MMMM'`: Month in year (January-December)
 *   * `'MMM'`: Month in year (Jan-Dec)
 *   * `'MM'`: Month in year, padded (01-12)
 *   * `'M'`: Month in year (1-12)
 *   * `'dd'`: Day in month, padded (01-31)
 *   * `'d'`: Day in month (1-31)
 *   * `'EEEE'`: Day in Week,(Sunday-Saturday)
 *   * `'EEE'`: Day in Week, (Sun-Sat)
 *   * `'HH'`: Hour in day, padded (00-23)
 *   * `'H'`: Hour in day (0-23)
 *   * `'hh'`: Hour in am/pm, padded (01-12)
 *   * `'h'`: Hour in am/pm, (1-12)
 *   * `'mm'`: Minute in hour, padded (00-59)
 *   * `'m'`: Minute in hour (0-59)
 *   * `'ss'`: Second in minute, padded (00-59)
 *   * `'s'`: Second in minute (0-59)
 *   * `'.sss' or ',sss'`: Millisecond in second, padded (000-999)
 *   * `'a'`: am/pm marker
 *   * `'Z'`: 4 digit (+sign) representation of the timezone offset (-1200-+1200)
 *
 *   `format` string can also be one of the following predefined
 *   {@link guide/i18n localizable formats}:
 *
 *   * `'medium'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y h:mm:ss a'` for en_US locale
 *     (e.g. Sep 3, 2010 12:05:08 pm)
 *   * `'short'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy h:mm a'` for en_US  locale (e.g. 9/3/10 12:05 pm)
 *   * `'fullDate'`: equivalent to `'EEEE, MMMM d,y'` for en_US  locale
 *     (e.g. Friday, September 3, 2010)
 *   * `'longDate'`: equivalent to `'MMMM d, y'` for en_US  locale (e.g. September 3, 2010)
 *   * `'mediumDate'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y'` for en_US  locale (e.g. Sep 3, 2010)
 *   * `'shortDate'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy'` for en_US locale (e.g. 9/3/10)
 *   * `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a'` for en_US locale (e.g. 12:05:08 pm)
 *   * `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm a'` for en_US locale (e.g. 12:05 pm)
 *
 *   `format` string can contain literal values. These need to be quoted with single quotes (e.g.
 *   `"h 'in the morning'"`). In order to output single quote, use two single quotes in a sequence
 *   (e.g. `"h 'o''clock'"`).
 *
 * @param {(Date|number|string)} date Date to format either as Date object, milliseconds (string or
 *    number) or various ISO 8601 datetime string formats (e.g. yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ and its
 *    shorter versions like yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmZ, yyyy-MM-dd or yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ). If no timezone is
 *    specified in the string input, the time is considered to be in the local timezone.
 * @param {string=} format Formatting rules (see Description). If not specified,
 *    `mediumDate` is used.
 * @returns {string} Formatted string or the input if input is not recognized as date/millis.

/**
 * @ngdoc filter
 * @name orderBy
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Orders a specified `array` by the `expression` predicate. It is ordered alphabetically
 * for strings and numerically for numbers. Note: if you notice numbers are not being sorted
 * correctly, make sure they are actually being saved as numbers and not strings.
 *
 * @param {Array} array The array to sort.
 * @param {function(*)|string|Array.<(function(*)|string)>} expression A predicate to be
 *    used by the comparator to determine the order of elements.
 *
 *    Can be one of:
 *
 *    - `function`: Getter function. The result of this function will be sorted using the
 *      `<`, `=`, `>` operator.
 *    - `string`: An Angular expression which evaluates to an object to order by, such as 'name'
 *      to sort by a property called 'name'. Optionally prefixed with `+` or `-` to control
 *      ascending or descending sort order (for example, +name or -name).
 *    - `Array`: An array of function or string predicates. The first predicate in the array
 *      is used for sorting, but when two items are equivalent, the next predicate is used.
 *
 * @param {boolean=} reverse Reverse the order of the array.
 * @returns {Array} Sorted copy of the source array.

 /**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name form
 * @restrict E
 *
 * @description
 * Directive that instantiates
 * {@link form.FormController FormController}.
 *
 * If the `name` attribute is specified, the form controller is published onto the current scope under
 * this name.
 *
 * # Alias: {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`}
 *
 * In Angular forms can be nested. This means that the outer form is valid when all of the child
 * forms are valid as well. However, browsers do not allow nesting of `<form>` elements, so
 * Angular provides the {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`} directive which behaves identically to
 * `<form>` but can be nested.  This allows you to have nested forms, which is very useful when
 * using Angular validation directives in forms that are dynamically generated using the
 * {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`} directive. Since you cannot dynamically generate the `name`
 * attribute of input elements using interpolation, you have to wrap each set of repeated inputs in an
 * `ngForm` directive and nest these in an outer `form` element.
 *
 *
 * # CSS classes
 *  - `ng-valid` is set if the form is valid.
 *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the form is invalid.
 *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the form is pristine.
 *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the form is dirty.
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 *
 * # Submitting a form and preventing the default action
 *
 * Since the role of forms in client-side Angular applications is different than in classical
 * roundtrip apps, it is desirable for the browser not to translate the form submission into a full
 * page reload that sends the data to the server. Instead some javascript logic should be triggered
 * to handle the form submission in an application-specific way.
 *
 * For this reason, Angular prevents the default action (form submission to the server) unless the
 * `<form>` element has an `action` attribute specified.
 *
 * You can use one of the following two ways to specify what javascript method should be called when
 * a form is submitted:
 *
 * - {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit} directive on the form element
 * - {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directive on the first
  *  button or input field of type submit (input[type=submit])
 *
 * To prevent double execution of the handler, use only one of the {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit}
 * or {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directives.
 * This is because of the following form submission rules in the HTML specification:
 *
 * - If a form has only one input field then hitting enter in this field triggers form submit
 * (`ngSubmit`)
 * - if a form has 2+ input fields and no buttons or input[type=submit] then hitting enter
 * doesn't trigger submit
 * - if a form has one or more input fields and one or more buttons or input[type=submit] then
 * hitting enter in any of the input fields will trigger the click handler on the *first* button or
 * input[type=submit] (`ngClick`) *and* a submit handler on the enclosing form (`ngSubmit`)
 *
 * @param {string=} name Name of the form. If specified, the form controller will be published into
 *                       related scope, under this name.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations in ngForm are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed.
 * These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`, `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any
 * other validations that are performed within the form. Animations in ngForm are similar to how
 * they work in ngClass and animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well
 * as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style a form element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-form {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-form.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
    <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true">
      <file name="index.html">
       <script>
         function Ctrl($scope) {

 * @description
 *
 * `NgModelController` provides API for the `ng-model` directive. The controller contains
 * services for data-binding, validation, CSS updates, and value formatting and parsing. It
 * purposefully does not contain any logic which deals with DOM rendering or listening to
 * DOM events. Such DOM related logic should be provided by other directives which make use of
 * `NgModelController` for data-binding.
 *
 * ## Custom Control Example
 * This example shows how to use `NgModelController` with a custom control to achieve
 * data-binding. Notice how different directives (`contenteditable`, `ng-model`, and `required`)
 * collaborate together to achieve the desired result.
 *
 * Note that `contenteditable` is an HTML5 attribute, which tells the browser to let the element
 * contents be edited in place by the user.  This will not work on older browsers.
 *
 * We are using the {@link ng.service:$sce $sce} service here and include the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize}
 * module to automatically remove "bad" content like inline event listener (e.g. `<span onclick="...">`).
 * However, as we are using `$sce` the model can still decide to to provide unsafe content if it marks
 * that content using the `$sce` service.
 *
 * <example name="NgModelController" module="customControl" deps="angular-sanitize.js">
    <file name="style.css">
      [contenteditable] {
        border: 1px solid black;

        min-height: 20px;

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngModel
 *
 * @element input
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngModel` directive binds an `input`,`select`, `textarea` (or custom form control) to a
 * property on the scope using {@link ngModel.NgModelController NgModelController},
 * which is created and exposed by this directive.
 *
 * `ngModel` is responsible for:
 *
 * - Binding the view into the model, which other directives such as `input`, `textarea` or `select`
 *   require.
 * - Providing validation behavior (i.e. required, number, email, url).
 * - Keeping the state of the control (valid/invalid, dirty/pristine, validation errors).
 * - Setting related css classes on the element (`ng-valid`, `ng-invalid`, `ng-dirty`, `ng-pristine`) including animations.
 * - Registering the control with its parent {@link ng.directive:form form}.
 *
 * Note: `ngModel` will try to bind to the property given by evaluating the expression on the
 * current scope. If the property doesn't already exist on this scope, it will be created
 * implicitly and added to the scope.
 *
 * For best practices on using `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - [https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes]
 *
 * For basic examples, how to use `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - {@link ng.directive:input input}
 *    - {@link input[text] text}
 *    - {@link input[checkbox] checkbox}
 *    - {@link input[radio] radio}
 *    - {@link input[number] number}
 *    - {@link input[email] email}
 *    - {@link input[url] url}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:select select}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:textarea textarea}
 *
 * # CSS classes
 * The following CSS classes are added and removed on the associated input/select/textarea element
 * depending on the validity of the model.
 *
 *  - `ng-valid` is set if the model is valid.
 *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the model is invalid.
 *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the model is pristine.
 *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the model is dirty.
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations within models are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed
 * on the input element which is attached to the model. These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`,
 * `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any other validations that are performed on the model itself.
 * The animations that are triggered within ngModel are similar to how they work in ngClass and
 * animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style an input element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-input {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-input.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
 * <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true">
     <file name="index.html">
       <script>
        function Ctrl($scope) {
          $scope.val = '1';
        }
       </script>
       <style>
         .my-input {
           -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;
           transition:all linear 0.5s;
           background: transparent;
         }
         .my-input.ng-invalid {
           color:white;
           background: red;
         }
       </style>
       Update input to see transitions when valid/invalid.
       Integer is a valid value.
       <form name="testForm" ng-controller="Ctrl">
         <input ng-model="val" ng-pattern="/^\d+$/" name="anim" class="my-input" />

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngBind
 * @restrict AC
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngBind` attribute tells Angular to replace the text content of the specified HTML element
 * with the value of a given expression, and to update the text content when the value of that
 * expression changes.
 *
 * Typically, you don't use `ngBind` directly, but instead you use the double curly markup like
 * `{{ expression }}` which is similar but less verbose.
 *
 * It is preferable to use `ngBind` instead of `{{ expression }}` when a template is momentarily
 * displayed by the browser in its raw state before Angular compiles it. Since `ngBind` is an
 * element attribute, it makes the bindings invisible to the user while the page is loading.
 *
 * An alternative solution to this problem would be using the
 * {@link ng.directive:ngCloak ngCloak} directive.
 *
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngBind {@link guide/expression Expression} to evaluate.

 * Enter a name in the Live Preview text box; the greeting below the text box changes instantly.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngClass
 * @restrict AC
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngClass` directive allows you to dynamically set CSS classes on an HTML element by databinding
 * an expression that represents all classes to be added.
 *
 * The directive operates in three different ways, depending on which of three types the expression
 * evaluates to:
 *
 * 1. If the expression evaluates to a string, the string should be one or more space-delimited class
 * names.
 *
 * 2. If the expression evaluates to an array, each element of the array should be a string that is
 * one or more space-delimited class names.
 *
 * 3. If the expression evaluates to an object, then for each key-value pair of the
 * object with a truthy value the corresponding key is used as a class name.
 *
 * The directive won't add duplicate classes if a particular class was already set.
 *
 * When the expression changes, the previously added classes are removed and only then the
 * new classes are added.
 *
 * @animations
 * add - happens just before the class is applied to the element
 * remove - happens just before the class is removed from the element
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngClass {@link guide/expression Expression} to eval. The result
 *   of the evaluation can be a string representing space delimited class
 *   names, an array, or a map of class names to boolean values. In the case of a map, the
 *   names of the properties whose values are truthy will be added as css classes to the
 *   element.
 *
 * @example Example that demonstrates basic bindings via ngClass directive.
   <example>
     <file name="index.html">

   ## Animations

   The example below demonstrates how to perform animations using ngClass.

   <example module="ngAnimate" deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true">
     <file name="index.html">
      <input id="setbtn" type="button" value="set" ng-click="myVar='my-class'">
      <input id="clearbtn" type="button" value="clear" ng-click="myVar=''">
      <br>
      <span class="base-class" ng-class="myVar">Sample Text</span>
     </file>
     <file name="style.css">
       .base-class {
         -webkit-transition:all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
         transition:all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
       }

       .base-class.my-class {
         color: red;
         font-size:3em;
       }
     </file>
     <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
       it('should check ng-class', function() {
         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).not.
           toMatch(/my-class/);

         element(by.id('setbtn')).click();

         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).
           toMatch(/my-class/);

         element(by.id('clearbtn')).click();

         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).not.
           toMatch(/my-class/);
       });
     </file>
   </example>


   ## ngClass and pre-existing CSS3 Transitions/Animations
   The ngClass directive still supports CSS3 Transitions/Animations even if they do not follow the ngAnimate CSS naming structure.
   Upon animation ngAnimate will apply supplementary CSS classes to track the start and end of an animation, but this will not hinder

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngCloak
 * @restrict AC
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngCloak` directive is used to prevent the Angular html template from being briefly
 * displayed by the browser in its raw (uncompiled) form while your application is loading. Use this
 * directive to avoid the undesirable flicker effect caused by the html template display.
 *
 * The directive can be applied to the `<body>` element, but the preferred usage is to apply
 * multiple `ngCloak` directives to small portions of the page to permit progressive rendering
 * of the browser view.
 *
 * `ngCloak` works in cooperation with the following css rule embedded within `angular.js` and
 * `angular.min.js`.
 * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```css
 * [ng\:cloak], [ng-cloak], [data-ng-cloak], [x-ng-cloak], .ng-cloak, .x-ng-cloak {
 *   display: none !important;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When this css rule is loaded by the browser, all html elements (including their children) that
 * are tagged with the `ngCloak` directive are hidden. When Angular encounters this directive
 * during the compilation of the template it deletes the `ngCloak` element attribute, making
 * the compiled element visible.
 *
 * For the best result, the `angular.js` script must be loaded in the head section of the html
 * document; alternatively, the css rule above must be included in the external stylesheet of the
 * application.
 *
 * Legacy browsers, like IE7, do not provide attribute selector support (added in CSS 2.1) so they
 * cannot match the `[ng\:cloak]` selector. To work around this limitation, you must add the css
 * class `ng-cloak` in addition to the `ngCloak` directive as shown in the example below.
 *
 * @element ANY
 *
 * @example
   <example>
     <file name="index.html">
        <div id="template1" ng-cloak>{{ 'hello' }}</div>
        <div id="template2" ng-cloak class="ng-cloak">{{ 'hello IE7' }}</div>

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngController
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngController` directive attaches a controller class to the view. This is a key aspect of how angular
 * supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
 *
 * MVC components in angular:
 *
 * * Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties
 *   are accessed through bindings.
 * * View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.
 * * Controller — The `ngController` directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business
 *   logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values
 *
 * Note that you can also attach controllers to the DOM by declaring it in a route definition
 * via the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. A common mistake is to declare the controller
 * again using `ng-controller` in the template itself.  This will cause the controller to be attached
 * and executed twice.
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @param {expression} ngController Name of a globally accessible constructor function or an
 *     {@link guide/expression expression} that on the current scope evaluates to a
 *     constructor function. The controller instance can be published into a scope property
 *     by specifying `as propertyName`.
 *
 * @example
 * Here is a simple form for editing user contact information. Adding, removing, clearing, and
 * greeting are methods declared on the controller (see source tab). These methods can
 * easily be called from the angular markup. Any changes to the data are automatically reflected
 * in the View without the need for a manual update.
 *
 * Two different declaration styles are included below:
 *
 * * one binds methods and properties directly onto the controller using `this`:
 * `ng-controller="SettingsController1 as settings"`
 * * one injects `$scope` into the controller:
 * `ng-controller="SettingsController2"`
 *
 * The second option is more common in the Angular community, and is generally used in boilerplates
 * and in this guide. However, there are advantages to binding properties directly to the controller
 * and avoiding scope.
 *
 * * Using `controller as` makes it obvious which controller you are accessing in the template when
 * multiple controllers apply to an element.
 * * If you are writing your controllers as classes you have easier access to the properties and
 * methods, which will appear on the scope, from inside the controller code.
 * * Since there is always a `.` in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal
 * inheritance masking primitives.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the `controller as` syntax.
 *
 * <example name="ngControllerAs">
 *   <file name="index.html">
 *    <div id="ctrl-as-exmpl" ng-controller="SettingsController1 as settings">

 * @element html
 * @description
 * Enables [CSP (Content Security Policy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP) support.
 *
 * This is necessary when developing things like Google Chrome Extensions.
 *
 * CSP forbids apps to use `eval` or `Function(string)` generated functions (among other things).
 * For us to be compatible, we just need to implement the "getterFn" in $parse without violating
 * any of these restrictions.
 *
 * AngularJS uses `Function(string)` generated functions as a speed optimization. Applying the `ngCsp`
 * directive will cause Angular to use CSP compatibility mode. When this mode is on AngularJS will
 * evaluate all expressions up to 30% slower than in non-CSP mode, but no security violations will
 * be raised.
 *
 * CSP forbids JavaScript to inline stylesheet rules. In non CSP mode Angular automatically
 * includes some CSS rules (e.g. {@link ng.directive:ngCloak ngCloak}).
 * To make those directives work in CSP mode, include the `angular-csp.css` manually.
 *
 * In order to use this feature put the `ngCsp` directive on the root element of the application.
 *
 * *Note: This directive is only available in the `ng-csp` and `data-ng-csp` attribute form.*
 *
 * @example
 * This example shows how to apply the `ngCsp` directive to the `html` tag.
   ```html
     <!doctype html>
     <html ng-app ng-csp>
     ...
     ...
     </html>
   ```
 */

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngIf
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngIf` directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an
 * {expression}. If the expression assigned to `ngIf` evaluates to a false
 * value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the
 * element is reinserted into the DOM.
 *
 * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the
 * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common
 * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's
 * position within the DOM, such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.
 *
 * Note that when an element is removed using `ngIf` its scope is destroyed and a new scope
 * is created when the element is restored.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from
 * its parent scope using
 * [prototypal inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/The-Nuances-of-Scope-Prototypal-Inheritance).
 * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to
 * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the
 * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.
 *
 * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior
 * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like
 * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element
 * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.
 *
 * Additionally, you can provide animations via the `ngAnimate` module to animate the `enter`
 * and `leave` effects.
 *
 * @animations
 * enter - happens just after the ngIf contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the ngIf container
 * leave - happens just before the ngIf contents are removed from the DOM
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 600
 * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then
 *     the element is removed from the DOM tree. If it is truthy a copy of the compiled
 *     element is added to the DOM tree.
 *
 * @example

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngPluralize
 * @restrict EA
 *
 * @description
 * `ngPluralize` is a directive that displays messages according to en-US localization rules.
 * These rules are bundled with angular.js, but can be overridden
 * (see {@link guide/i18n Angular i18n} dev guide). You configure ngPluralize directive
 * by specifying the mappings between
 * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
 * and the strings to be displayed.
 *
 * # Plural categories and explicit number rules
 * There are two
 * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
 * in Angular's default en-US locale: "one" and "other".
 *
 * While a plural category may match many numbers (for example, in en-US locale, "other" can match
 * any number that is not 1), an explicit number rule can only match one number. For example, the
 * explicit number rule for "3" matches the number 3. There are examples of plural categories
 * and explicit number rules throughout the rest of this documentation.
 *
 * # Configuring ngPluralize
 * You configure ngPluralize by providing 2 attributes: `count` and `when`.
 * You can also provide an optional attribute, `offset`.
 *
 * The value of the `count` attribute can be either a string or an {@link guide/expression
 * Angular expression}; these are evaluated on the current scope for its bound value.
 *
 * The `when` attribute specifies the mappings between plural categories and the actual
 * string to be displayed. The value of the attribute should be a JSON object.
 *
 * The following example shows how to configure ngPluralize:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ng-pluralize count="personCount"
                 when="{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',
 *                      'one': '1 person is viewing.',
 *                      'other': '{} people are viewing.'}">
 * </ng-pluralize>
 *```
 *
 * In the example, `"0: Nobody is viewing."` is an explicit number rule. If you did not
 * specify this rule, 0 would be matched to the "other" category and "0 people are viewing"
 * would be shown instead of "Nobody is viewing". You can specify an explicit number rule for
 * other numbers, for example 12, so that instead of showing "12 people are viewing", you can
 * show "a dozen people are viewing".
 *
 * You can use a set of closed braces (`{}`) as a placeholder for the number that you want substituted
 * into pluralized strings. In the previous example, Angular will replace `{}` with
 * <span ng-non-bindable>`{{personCount}}`</span>. The closed braces `{}` is a placeholder
 * for <span ng-non-bindable>{{numberExpression}}</span>.
 *
 * # Configuring ngPluralize with offset
 * The `offset` attribute allows further customization of pluralized text, which can result in
 * a better user experience. For example, instead of the message "4 people are viewing this document",
 * you might display "John, Kate and 2 others are viewing this document".
 * The offset attribute allows you to offset a number by any desired value.
 * Let's take a look at an example:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ng-pluralize count="personCount" offset=2
 *               when="{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',
 *                      '1': '{{person1}} is viewing.',
 *                      '2': '{{person1}} and {{person2}} are viewing.',
 *                      'one': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and one other person are viewing.',
 *                      'other': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and {} other people are viewing.'}">
 * </ng-pluralize>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that we are still using two plural categories(one, other), but we added
 * three explicit number rules 0, 1 and 2.
 * When one person, perhaps John, views the document, "John is viewing" will be shown.
 * When three people view the document, no explicit number rule is found, so
 * an offset of 2 is taken off 3, and Angular uses 1 to decide the plural category.
 * In this case, plural category 'one' is matched and "John, Marry and one other person are viewing"
 * is shown.
 *
 * Note that when you specify offsets, you must provide explicit number rules for
 * numbers from 0 up to and including the offset. If you use an offset of 3, for example,
 * you must provide explicit number rules for 0, 1, 2 and 3. You must also provide plural strings for
 * plural categories "one" and "other".
 *
 * @param {string|expression} count The variable to be bound to.
 * @param {string} when The mapping between plural category to its corresponding strings.
 * @param {number=} offset Offset to deduct from the total number.
 *
 * @example
    <example>
      <file name="index.html">
        <script>
          function Ctrl($scope) {
            $scope.person1 = 'Igor';

 * The `ngRepeat` directive instantiates a template once per item from a collection. Each template
 * instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item,
 * and `$index` is set to the item index or key.
 *
 * Special properties are exposed on the local scope of each template instance, including:
 *
 * | Variable  | Type            | Details                                                                     |
 * |-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `$index`  | {@type number}  | iterator offset of the repeated element (0..length-1)                       |
 * | `$first`  | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is first in the iterator.                      |
 * | `$middle` | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is between the first and last in the iterator. |
 * | `$last`   | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is last in the iterator.                       |
 * | `$even`   | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is even (otherwise false).           |
 * | `$odd`    | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is odd (otherwise false).            |
 *
 * Creating aliases for these properties is possible with {@link ng.directive:ngInit `ngInit`}.
 * This may be useful when, for instance, nesting ngRepeats.
 *
 * # Special repeat start and end points
 * To repeat a series of elements instead of just one parent element, ngRepeat (as well as other ng directives) supports extending
 * the range of the repeater by defining explicit start and end points by using **ng-repeat-start** and **ng-repeat-end** respectively.
 * The **ng-repeat-start** directive works the same as **ng-repeat**, but will repeat all the HTML code (including the tag it's defined on)
 * up to and including the ending HTML tag where **ng-repeat-end** is placed.
 *
 * The example below makes use of this feature:
 * ```html
 *   <header ng-repeat-start="item in items">
 *     Header {{ item }}
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 *   <footer ng-repeat-end>
 *     Footer {{ item }}
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * And with an input of {@type ['A','B']} for the items variable in the example above, the output will evaluate to:
 * ```html
 *   <header>
 *     Header A
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body A
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer A
 *   </footer>
 *   <header>
 *     Header B
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body B
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer B
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * The custom start and end points for ngRepeat also support all other HTML directive syntax flavors provided in AngularJS (such
 * as **data-ng-repeat-start**, **x-ng-repeat-start** and **ng:repeat-start**).
 *
 * @animations
 * **.enter** - when a new item is added to the list or when an item is revealed after a filter
 *
 * **.leave** - when an item is removed from the list or when an item is filtered out
 *
 * **.move** - when an adjacent item is filtered out causing a reorder or when the item contents are reordered
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 1000
 * @param {repeat_expression} ngRepeat The expression indicating how to enumerate a collection. These
 *   formats are currently supported:
 *
 *   * `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and `expression`
 *     is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `album in artist.albums`.
 *
 *   * `(key, value) in expression` – where `key` and `value` can be any user defined identifiers,
 *     and `expression` is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `(name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}`.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression track by tracking_expression` – You can also provide an optional tracking function
 *     which can be used to associate the objects in the collection with the DOM elements. If no tracking function
 *     is specified the ng-repeat associates elements by identity in the collection. It is an error to have
 *     more than one tracking function to resolve to the same key. (This would mean that two distinct objects are
 *     mapped to the same DOM element, which is not possible.)  Filters should be applied to the expression,
 *     before specifying a tracking expression.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items` is equivalent to `item in items track by $id(item)`. This implies that the DOM elements
 *     will be associated by item identity in the array.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by $id(item)`. A built in `$id()` function can be used to assign a unique
 *     `$$hashKey` property to each item in the array. This property is then used as a key to associated DOM elements
 *     with the corresponding item in the array by identity. Moving the same object in array would move the DOM
 *     element in the same way in the DOM.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by item.id` is a typical pattern when the items come from the database. In this
 *     case the object identity does not matter. Two objects are considered equivalent as long as their `id`
 *     property is same.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:searchText track by item.id` is a pattern that might be used to apply a filter
 *     to items in conjunction with a tracking expression.
 *
 * @example
 * This example initializes the scope to a list of names and
 * then uses `ngRepeat` to display every person:

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngShow
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngShow` directive shows or hides the given HTML element based on the expression
 * provided to the ngShow attribute. The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding
 * the `ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined
 * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).
 * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is visible) -->
 * <div ng-show="myValue"></div>
 *
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is hidden) -->
 * <div ng-show="myValue" class="ng-hide"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the ngShow expression evaluates to false then the ng-hide CSS class is added to the class attribute
 * on the element causing it to become hidden. When true, the ng-hide CSS class is removed
 * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** Here is a list of values that ngShow will consider as a falsy value (case insensitive):<br />
 * "f" / "0" / "false" / "no" / "n" / "[]"
 * </div>
 *
 * ## Why is !important used?
 *
 * You may be wondering why !important is used for the .ng-hide CSS class. This is because the `.ng-hide` selector
 * can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as simple
 * as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear visible.
 * This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.
 *
 * By using !important, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between CSS selector
 * specificity (when !important isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a developer chooses to override the
 * styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a matter of using !important in their own CSS code.
 *
 * ### Overriding .ng-hide
 *
 * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display:none!important`. If you wish to change
 * the hide behavior with ngShow/ngHide then this can be achieved by restating the styles for the `.ng-hide`
 * class in CSS:
 *
 * ```css
 * .ng-hide {
 *   //this is just another form of hiding an element
 *   display:block!important;
 *   position:absolute;
 *   top:-9999px;
 *   left:-9999px;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * By default you don't need to override in CSS anything and the animations will work around the display style.
 *
 * ## A note about animations with ngShow
 *
 * Animations in ngShow/ngHide work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the directive expression
 * is true and false. This system works like the animation system present with ngClass except that
 * you must also include the !important flag to override the display property
 * so that you can perform an animation when the element is hidden during the time of the animation.
 *
 * ```css
 * //
 * //a working example can be found at the bottom of this page
 * //
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add, .my-element.ng-hide-remove {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, as of AngularJS version 1.2.17 (and 1.3.0-beta.11), there is no need to change the display
 * property to block during animation states--ngAnimate will handle the style toggling automatically for you.
 *
 * @animations
 * addClass: .ng-hide - happens after the ngShow expression evaluates to a truthy value and the just before contents are set to visible
 * removeClass: .ng-hide - happens after the ngShow expression evaluates to a non truthy value and just before the contents are set to hidden
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngShow If the {@link guide/expression expression} is truthy

 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngStyle
 *
 * {@link guide/expression Expression} which evals to an
 * object whose keys are CSS style names and values are corresponding values for those CSS
 * keys.
 *
 * Since some CSS style names are not valid keys for an object, they must be quoted.
 * See the 'background-color' style in the example below.
 *
 * @example
   <example>
     <file name="index.html">
        <input type="button" value="set color" ng-click="myStyle={color:'red'}">
        <input type="button" value="set background" ng-click="myStyle={'background-color':'blue'}">

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngSwitch
 * @restrict EA
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngSwitch` directive is used to conditionally swap DOM structure on your template based on a scope expression.
 * Elements within `ngSwitch` but without `ngSwitchWhen` or `ngSwitchDefault` directives will be preserved at the location
 * as specified in the template.
 *
 * The directive itself works similar to ngInclude, however, instead of downloading template code (or loading it
 * from the template cache), `ngSwitch` simply chooses one of the nested elements and makes it visible based on which element
 * matches the value obtained from the evaluated expression. In other words, you define a container element
 * (where you place the directive), place an expression on the **`on="..."` attribute**
 * (or the **`ng-switch="..."` attribute**), define any inner elements inside of the directive and place
 * a when attribute per element. The when attribute is used to inform ngSwitch which element to display when the on
 * expression is evaluated. If a matching expression is not found via a when attribute then an element with the default
 * attribute is displayed.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * Be aware that the attribute values to match against cannot be expressions. They are interpreted
 * as literal string values to match against.
 * For example, **`ng-switch-when="someVal"`** will match against the string `"someVal"` not against the
 * value of the expression `$scope.someVal`.
 * </div>

 * @animations
 * enter - happens after the ngSwitch contents change and the matched child element is placed inside the container
 * leave - happens just after the ngSwitch contents change and just before the former contents are removed from the DOM
 *
 * @usage
 *
 * ```
 * <ANY ng-switch="expression">
 *   <ANY ng-switch-when="matchValue1">...</ANY>
 *   <ANY ng-switch-when="matchValue2">...</ANY>
 *   <ANY ng-switch-default>...</ANY>
 * </ANY>
 * ```
 *
 *
 * @scope
 * @priority 800
 * @param {*} ngSwitch|on expression to match against <tt>ng-switch-when</tt>.
 * On child elements add:
 *
 * * `ngSwitchWhen`: the case statement to match against. If match then this
 *   case will be displayed. If the same match appears multiple times, all the
 *   elements will be displayed.
 * * `ngSwitchDefault`: the default case when no other case match. If there
 *   are multiple default cases, all of them will be displayed when no other
 *   case match.

 *
 * # `ngOptions`
 *
 * The `ngOptions` attribute can be used to dynamically generate a list of `<option>`
 * elements for the `<select>` element using the array or object obtained by evaluating the
 * `ngOptions` comprehension_expression.
 *
 * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the array element or object property
 * represented by the selected option will be bound to the model identified by the `ngModel`
 * directive.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** `ngModel` compares by reference, not value. This is important when binding to an
 * array of objects. See an example [in this jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/qWzTb/).
 * </div>
 *
 * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can
 * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or "not selected"
 * option. See example below for demonstration.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** `ngOptions` provides an iterator facility for the `<option>` element which should be used instead
 * of {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat} when you want the
 * `select` model to be bound to a non-string value. This is because an option element can only
 * be bound to string values at present.
 * </div>
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
 * @param {string=} required The control is considered valid only if value is entered.
 * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
 *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
 *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
 * @param {comprehension_expression=} ngOptions in one of the following forms:
 *
 *   * for array data sources:
 *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label`  **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *   * for object data sources:
 *     * `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for (`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`group by`** `group`
 *         **`for` `(`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *
 * Where:
 *
 *   * `array` / `object`: an expression which evaluates to an array / object to iterate over.
 *   * `value`: local variable which will refer to each item in the `array` or each property value
 *      of `object` during iteration.
 *   * `key`: local variable which will refer to a property name in `object` during iteration.
 *   * `label`: The result of this expression will be the label for `<option>` element. The
 *     `expression` will most likely refer to the `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`).
 *   * `select`: The result of this expression will be bound to the model of the parent `<select>`
 *      element. If not specified, `select` expression will default to `value`.
 *   * `group`: The result of this expression will be used to group options using the `<optgroup>`
 *      DOM element.
 *   * `trackexpr`: Used when working with an array of objects. The result of this expression will be
 *      used to identify the objects in the array. The `trackexpr` will most likely refer to the
 *     `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`).

	3. Use the same single mechanism to support "private" and "user" data.
	4. _Never_ expose "private" data to user code (TODO: Drop _data, _removeData)
	5. Avoid exposing implementation details on user objects (eg. expando properties)
